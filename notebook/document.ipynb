These interconnected sensors generate an \\nenormous volume of real-time data, providing unprecedented insights into the performance and health of the \\nsmart grid infrastructure [1]. However, with the ever-growing complexity and scale of these systems, the task \\nof monitoring and maintaining the vast array of devices poses significant challenges. In this context, anomaly \\ndetection using machine learning techniques has emerged as a promising approach to proactively address \\npotential equipment malfunctions and optimize maintenance strategies [2,5].Predictive maintenance, enabled \\nby anomaly detection, offers a proactive and intelligent way to manage smart grid assets. Traditional \\nmaintenance approaches, often reactive and time-based, have proven to be inefficient and costly, leading to \\nunplanned downtime and operational disruptions [3]. In contrast, predictive maintenance leverages the power \\nof advanced data analytics to detect anomalies in real-time sensor data [4]. By identifying deviations from \\nnormal patterns and predicting potential equipment failures, utilities can schedule maintenance activities \\nstrategically, minimize downtime, and optimize resource allocation. \\nThe integration of machine learning techniques for anomaly detection in IoT sensor data holds \\nimmense potential in revolutionizing the way we maintain and operate smart grids [6]. By harnessing the \\npower of technological innovations like data analytics and predictive maintenance, utilities can proactively \\naddress equipment failures, enhance system resilience, and ensure a reliable and sustainable energy supply \\nfor the future [7].

Traditionally, the energy industry relied on reactive maintenance practices, \\nwhere equipment repairs were performed only after failures occurred. However, with the transformation of \\nthe power grid into a dynamic and interconnected ecosystem, traditional maintenance approaches proved \\ninadequate in meeting the demands of modern energy management [1,3]. \\n2.1.1  Proactive Approach to Maintenance: \\nPredictive maintenance introduces a proactive approach to equipment upkeep in smart grids. By \\nharnessing the power of data analytics and machine learning algorithms, utilities can anticipate potential \\nequipment failures and irregularities before they manifest as major issues. This proactive stance empowers \\nutilities to address maintenance needs in a timely manner, preventing catastrophic failures and costly \\nunplanned downtime [9]. \\n2.1.2  Minimizing Operational Disruptions: \\nUnplanned downtime can have significant financial implications for utilities and consumers alike. \\nThrough anomaly detection in IoT sensor data, predictive maintenance can identify potential equipment \\nmalfunctions early, allowing utilities to schedule maintenance activities during periods of low demand or \\nplanned maintenance windows. This minimizes the impact on operations and ensures uninterrupted energy \\nsupply to consumers [4]. \\n2.1.3  Asset Performance Optimization: \\nPredictive maintenance enables utilities to optimize the performance of critical assets in the smart \\ngrid infrastructure. By detecting anomalies and deviations in sensor data, utilities can pinpoint \\nunderperforming equipment and take proactive measures to rectify issues. This approach not only extends \\nthe lifespan of assets but also ensures their optimal performance, contributing to increased grid efficiency \\nand cost savings [3]. \\n2.1.4  Resource Allocation Efficiency: \\nTraditional maintenance practices often involve the periodic inspection of all equipment, leading to \\ninefficient resource allocation.

Accurate and reliable \\nanomaly detection is critical to proactively identify equipment malfunctions and irregularities, enabling \\nutilities to optimize maintenance strategies and enhance grid reliability [17]. Performance evaluation ensures \\nthat the selected models are capable of detecting anomalies with high precision and recall, minimizing false \\npositives and negatives. This study therefore recommends the following checklist for evaluating machine \\nlearning algorithms for implementing anomaly detection models:  \\n2.4.1.  Performance Metrics: \\nSeveral performance metrics are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the anomaly detection models. \\nPrecision measures the proportion of true anomalies among all detected anomalies, while recall (or \\nsensitivity) quantifies the proportion of true anomalies correctly identified by the model. The F1-score, a \\nharmonic mean of precision and recall, provides a balanced assessment of the model's performance. \\nAdditionally, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is utilized to assess the model's ability to \\ntradeoff between a true positive rate and a false positive rate at various classification thresholds [18]. \\n2.4.2  Cross-Validation: \\nCross-validation can be employed to assess the model's generalization ability and robustness. The \\ndataset in this case is partitioned into multiple subsets (folds), with each fold used as both training and testing \\ndata. The process is repeated several times, and the average performance metrics are calculated. Cross-\\nvalidation can help to detect overfitting or underfitting issues and ensures that the models perform well on \\nunseen data [19]. \\n2.4.3.  Hyperparameter Tuning: \\nMachine learning algorithms often have hyperparameters that need to be set before training. \\nHyperparameter tuning involves systematically searching through different combinations of hyperparameters \\nto find the configuration that yields the best performance. Techniques such as grid search or random search \\ncan be employed to identify the optimal hyperparameter values, further improving the model's performance \\n[20]. \\n2.4.4  Out-of-Sample Testing: \\nOnce the optimal anomaly detection model is selected and fine-tuned, it is subjected to out-of-\\nsample testing on a separate validation dataset that the model has not seen during training. This validation \\ndataset represents real-world scenarios and ensures that the model's performance remains consistent and \\nreliable on unseen data [21]. \\n2.4.5 \\n Model Deployment and Monitoring: \\nAfter thorough performance evaluation and model selection, the final anomaly detection model \\nshould be deployed in the smart grid infrastructure for real-time monitoring. Continuous monitoring and \\nperiodic re-evaluation of the model's performance ensure that it continues to deliver accurate and reliable \\nanomaly detection results over time [22].Performance evaluation and model selection are critical components \\nof implementing anomaly detection in IoT sensor data for predictive maintenance in smart grids. Rigorous \\nevaluation of machine learning models enables utilities to identify the most effective anomaly detection \\napproach, ensuring the early identification of equipment malfunctions, optimized maintenance planning, and \\nenhanced grid reliability. By adopting robust and accurate models, utilities can harness the full potential of \\nanomaly detection to drive proactive maintenance strategies and build resilient and efficient smart grid \\ninfrastructures for the future.  \\n2.5  \\nPossible Integration and Deployment Challenges: \\nWhile anomaly detection in IoT sensor data using machine learning techniques holds significant \\npromise for predictive maintenance in smart grids, its successful integration and deployment into real-world \\noperational environments present several challenges. Addressing these challenges is crucial to ensure that the \\nanomaly detection system functions effectively and provides tangible benefits to utility companies.\"),\n",

Ensuring data privacy and safeguarding against cybersecurity threats is of utmost \\nimportance. The integration of anomaly detection systems should adhere to robust data encryption, access \\ncontrol, and authentication mechanisms to protect against potential breaches [18]. \\n2.5.4  Model Interpretability: \\nMachine learning models used for anomaly detection are often complex and difficult to interpret. In \\nthe context of critical infrastructure like smart grids, model interpretability is essential for gaining insights \\ninto why anomalies are detected and making informed decisions. Employing techniques such as LIME \\n(Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) or SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) can help \\nprovide explanations for individual anomaly instances [27]. \\n2.5.5  Data Imbalance: \\nAnomalies are, by nature, infrequent in the dataset compared to normal data. This class imbalance \\ncan bias the model towards normal data, leading to lower recall for anomaly detection. Addressing data \\nimbalance through techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or using appropriate evaluation metrics is \\ncrucial to ensure accurate anomaly detection [24,26]. \\n2.5.6  Model Adaptation and Drift: \\nThe smart grid environment is dynamic, and the underlying data distribution may change over time \\ndue to system upgrades, changing consumer behavior, or new equipment installations. Anomaly detection \\nmodels must adapt to these changes and accommodate data drift to maintain their effectiveness over \\nextended periods. Continuous model monitoring and adaptation strategies are essential for ensuring sustained \\nperformance [19]. \\n2.5.7 \\n Human-In-The-Loop: \\nAnomaly detection systems should incorporate human-in-the-loop capabilities to allow human \\noperators and domain experts to review and validate detected anomalies.

Introduction\\nHydroponics is a soilless cultivation method that supplies nutrients to the crops\\nthrough a closed-loop irrigation system in which the plant roots are usually submerged\\nin the nutrient solution [1,2]. The nutrient solution contains both macronutrients and\\nmicronutrients, which are essential for the growth of plants [3]. Macronutrients and\\nmicronutrients are consumed by plants in larger and smaller quantities, respectively, to\\nsupport various metabolic and cellular processes [4]. Therefore, the precision and efficiency\\nof the hydroponic nutrient solution dosing system are critical to ensure optimal crop\\ngrowth [5]. Research regarding hydroponic nutrient dosing systems usually consists of\\nthe adjustment process of critical variables such as the potential of hydrogen (pH) and\\nAgriEngineering 2025, 7, 43\\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/agriengineering7020043'),\n",

Furthermore, these variables are controlled in different values\\ndepending on the optimal conditions required by specific crops [6,7].\\nThe EC is a crucial parameter in hydroponics, as it directly influences nutrient avail-\\nability, water uptake, and overall plant growth, making precise management essential for\\noptimal yield and quality. For instance, Wongsorn et al. examined the impact of different\\nEC levels (1, 2, 3, and 4 mS/cm) on the vegetative growth of Pepino (Solanum muricatum).\\nTheir results show that EC levels significantly influenced plant growth parameters. EC\\nlevels of 2 and 3 mS/cm led to the highest chlorophyll fluorescence and leaf green index,\\nwhile an EC of 4 mS/cm resulted in the greatest plant height, canopy width, and stem\\ndiameter. Lower EC levels (1 and 2 mS/cm) were associated with increased flowering\\npercentages [8]. In addition, research on lettuce grown in vertical hydroponic systems has\\nrevealed that an EC level of 2.5 mS/cm produced the maximum yield, while an EC of\\n1.5 mS/cm resulted in the highest vitamin C and chlorophyll content [9]. This indicates that\\ndifferent EC levels can optimize either yield or quality depending on the desired outcome.\\nOn the other hand, the pH is also a critical factor in hydroponics. It directly affects\\nnutrient solubility and availability, root health, and overall plant growth. Thus, making\\nprecise pH management essential for optimal crop performance. For example, Hopkin-\\nson et al. found that extreme pH levels (both very acidic and very basic) hindered the\\ngrowth of bush beans (Phaseolus vulgaris). Plants grown in nutrient solutions with a pH of\\n5–6 exhibited healthier growth, while those at pH 8–9 showed stunted growth, thus reduc-\\ning internode length and signs of nutrient deficiencies. The optimal pH range for bush\\nbeans was identified as 5.6–6.2 to ensure adequate nutrient solubility and uptake [10].\\nMoreover, research on spinach grown hydroponically highlighted that maintaining a pH\\nrange of 5.5–6.5 led to faster growth and better nutrient absorption. When pH deviated\\nfrom this range, plants exhibited pale yellow leaves and reduced growth due to insufficient\\nnutrient uptake [11]. Therefore, the growth of plants in hydroponics depends equally on\\nboth pH and EC, as both parameters must be carefully regulated within their optimal\\nranges as shown in Figure 1. Unfortunately, farmers often face challenges in maintaining\\nconstant control over these variables [12]. Thus, the implementation of an automated\\ndosing system is becoming increasingly essential.\\nFigure 1. Nutrient availability across different pH levels.

The automation process within this framework relies on activating\\ndosing actuators, which are controlled by predetermined threshold values for the relevant\\nvariables. This operational framework is exemplified in a flow chart provided by Hakam\\net al. [71]. This system continually compares the variables’ values against the set thresholds.\\nDosing actuators, such as servos [45], solenoid valves [33], and peristaltic pumps [50],\\nare triggered when variable values fall outside the acceptable range. Conversely, these\\nactuators are deactivated once the values realign with the specified thresholds.\\nThe PID control method is less utilized as a dosing framework. The PID control system\\nfunctions as a feedback mechanism, continuously calculating the error value by assessing\\nthe difference between the current measurement and the desired setpoint. For instance,\\nRyan et al. [25] determined the error value based on the variance from the pH setpoint\\nrange of 5.5 to 6.5. This error computation can then be leveraged to regulate the activation\\nof the dosing pump, utilizing pulse width modulation.\\nThe implementation of fuzzy logic in nutrient dosing frameworks typically involves a\\nsequence of steps: (1) fuzzification, (2) fuzzy inference, and (3) defuzzification [34]. During\\nfuzzification, input and output variables are defined as crisp values and are assigned to a\\nmembership function [37]. These variables are then modeled linguistically or mathemat-\\nically according to the applied fuzzy inference system [43]. This system operates based\\non “if-then” rules and the “and” fuzzy logic operator. Defuzzification involves transform-\\ning aggregated fuzzy output into a singular, precise value. Fakhrurroja et al. [42] have\\nexemplified this by converting the fuzzy output regarding pump activation time.\\nMachine learning is also increasingly employed in nutrient dosing frameworks. Its\\napplication involves processing extensive datasets, typically divided into two categories:\\na training dataset and a testing dataset [49,83]. The training dataset is used to develop\\na model that guides the decision-making process for activating the dosing actuator. For\\nexample, Albert et al. [99] implemented the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) machine learning\\ntechnique to determine the appropriate activation timing for a dosing pump. In a different\\nstudy, Arora et al. [14] used an artificial neural network (ANN) to regulate the pH of a\\nnutrient solution based on the color of the plant, which was determined by the red–green–\\nblue (RGB) values of image pixels. In this context, machine learning falls under predictive\\nanalytics, which entails using predictive models or decision-making processes to estimate\\nthe nutrient solution’s final pH and EC measurements.\\nThe reviewed studies indicate using statistical techniques as predictive analytics in\\nthe nutrient dosing framework. This approach primarily involves regression analysis to\\npropose predictive models, relating dependent variables (responses) with independent\\nvariables (predictors). The selection of the regression method depends on the number of\\npredictors and responses involved. For instance, Abd Rahman et al. [32] employed linear\\nregression to control the EC of the nutrient solution by predicting the activation time of\\nthe dosing pump. Another prevalent method is multiple linear regression, which predicts\\na response based on several predictors. Helmy et al. [56] conducted research aiming to\\nregulate the pH level of the nutrient solution, considering two predictors: the nutrient\\nsolution level and the time required to activate the dosing pump.\\nIn conclusion, the nutrient dosing frameworks in hydroponics can be categorized\\ninto two primary approaches: feedback loop and predictive analytics. The feedback loop\\nframework, depicted in Figure 5a, emphasizes real-time threshold monitoring and im-\\nmediate corrective actions to maintain optimal solution parameters. In contrast, the\\npredictive analytics framework, shown in Figure 5b, leverages data-driven methods\\nto anticipate input variable adjustments, enabling precise and efficient dosing deci-\\nsions. Together, these frameworks illustrate the balance between reactive control and'),\n",

Alkaline solutions, often referred to as base solutions, counteract\\nacidity [51]. Various acidic solutions are utilized, including nitric acid [30], phosphoric\\nacid [70], citric acid [25], acetic acid [67] and hydrochloric acid [95]. Conversely, to increase\\nthe pH, compounds such as sodium bicarbonate [58], potassium hydroxide [31], and\\nsodium hydroxide [95], are employed.\\n\\xa0\\n(a)\\xa0\\n(b)\\xa0\\nFigure 6. Dosing variables. (a) The frequency of individual variables included (b) the frequency of\\nintegration of variables in a dosing system.\\nThe concentration of hydroponic nutrient solution is represented by either EC or\\nTDS. EC measures the ability of a nutrient solution to conduct electrical current [110]. On\\nthe other hand, TDS quantifies the concentration of dissolved solid particles [111]. Low\\nEC and TDS measurements mean insufficient nutrients, while high values can cause salt-\\ninduced plant stress [112]. Research indicates a strong correlation between EC and TDS.\\nThe correlation between EC and TDS has been studied over the years, with Sulastri and\\nAkhdiana [113] stating that these variables are closely related to each other. They can be\\ncorrelated using the following equation: TDS = k x EC, where k is a constant value either\\n0.55 or 0.75 [109]. To ensure optimal plant growth in hydroponic cultivation, the EC and\\nTDS measurements must be constantly regulated.\\nNST in hydroponics is another critical factor affecting plant growth and nutrient\\nabsorption. Optimal NST is crucial for enhancing crop growth and minimizing potential\\nharm [114]. Higher NST levels have been found to enhance the solubility of minerals,\\nthereby improving plant nutrient uptake as solute dissolution rates increase with tempera-\\nture [13]. Additionally, NST significantly influences oxygen availability in the root zone\\nof the plants. Research has shown that root zone temperature is integral in modulating\\noxygen availability and consumption, which in turn affects plant growth and physiological\\nfunctions [115,116].\\nNSV in hydroponic systems significantly influences the pH and EC of the solution.\\nResearch indicates that NSV fluctuations can cause ion concentration and overall nutrient\\ncontent changes, affecting EC and pH levels. Specifically, NSV adjustment directly impacts\\nthe EC of the nutrient solution: an increase in NSV dilutes ion concentration, reducing EC,\\nwhile a decrease in NSV raises ion concentration, increasing EC [117,118].

Adjusting NSV affects the balance of acidic and\\nbasic components in the nutrient solution, leading to pH fluctuations. An increased NSV\\ntypically raises the pH by diluting the solution, whereas a decreased NSV concentrates\\non the solution and lowers the pH [119,120]. Consequently, NSV is a critical factor in\\ndetermining the acidity or alkalinity of the nutrient solution. Understanding and controlling\\nNSV is crucial for maintaining optimal nutrient levels and pH balance, ensuring healthy\\nplant growth and development in hydroponic environments.\\nFigure 6b shows the inclusion of dosing variables in a single system. The selection\\nof variables is vital in assessing the effectiveness and reliability of a dosing framework.\\nContinuous monitoring and control of pH, EC, TDS, NST, and NSV are critical for effective\\nand efficient nutrient dosing systems. Notably, when both a pH and an EC or TDS probe are\\nimmersed in the same solution, using an analog isolator module is imperative to prevent\\nelectrical interference. Such interference can lead to inaccurate readings of both EC and pH\\nlevels [75]. It is essential to include both pH and either EC or TDS in a dosing operation\\nas these variables could be used as guidelines to avoid certain unwanted occurrences\\nsuch as nutrient precipitations [121]. However, the inclusion of NSV in the variable\\nset is not mandatory. Omitting NSV from the dosing framework implies the absence\\nof a normalization procedure, meaning that the NSV is not adjusted to a normalized\\nvolume. Consequently, such a dosing framework would not be suitable for use during\\nthe replenishment of hydroponic nutrient solutions, where complete replacement of the\\nsolution is necessary.\\n3.4. Significance of Dosing Variables Across Various Frameworks\\nThe analysis of dosing variables across hydroponic nutrient dosing frameworks is cru-\\ncial for optimizing systems, evaluating frameworks, and guiding future research.

Therefore, only significant variables should be included in\\nthe predictive models to optimize the dosing framework. The variables are divided into\\ntwo classifications: (1) controlled variables and (2) confounding variables, as shown in\\nTable 3.\\nTable 3. Classifications of dosing variables.

Recommended procedure to optimize the proposed hydroponic dosing frameworks.\\n5. Conclusions\\nEffective controls of hydroponic nutrient solutions are crucial for the success of hydro-\\nponics cultivation. This systematic scoping review has outlined various frameworks for\\nhydroponic nutrient dosing operations by comprehensively reviewing 81 research articles\\non the hydroponic nutrient dosing framework. These frameworks are categorized into\\ntwo domains: feedback loop and predictive analytics. Each domain influences whether\\ndosing operations are conducted sequentially or simultaneously, affecting the required\\ndosing time. The study emphasizes the importance of critical dosing variables, including\\npH, EC or TDS, NST, and NSV. In detail, pH, EC, and TDS are vital variables that need to be\\nmaintained within specific thresholds, while NSV is crucial when normalization procedures\\nare implemented. On the other hand, the measurement of NST is essential to include the\\ntemperature compensation factor while measuring pH, EC, and TDS.\\nThis comprehensive review also highlights the crucial significance and complex rela-\\ntionship between these dosing variables. However, these variables must be included in a\\nsingle dosing system to enhance performance. The insights gained from this review lay a\\nrobust foundation for a thorough understanding of the various aspects of nutrient dosing\\nstrategies, significantly enhancing agricultural practices in precision and efficiency.\\nHowever, this scoping review is limited to research articles, and including review\\narticles in future studies may provide additional insights into hydroponic nutrient dosing\\nsystems. We discovered that the existing nutrient dosing frameworks need to be revised\\nin order to be robust. Future research is encouraged to utilize and optimize our proposed\\ndosing framework, which may offer significant improvements. Our proposed framework\\nis expected to significantly contribute to nutrient dosing operations’ robustness, accuracy,\\nand efficiency, representing a meaningful advancement in precision hydroponics. This\\ncomprehensive approach aims to address current challenges and pave the way for more\\nefficient and effective hydroponic farming practices.\\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, H.S., A.A.Y. and M.K.M.N.; methodology, H.S.; software,\\nH.S.; validation, H.S., A.A.Y. and M.K.M.N.; formal analysis, H.S.; investigation, H.S.; resources,\\nH.S.; data curation, H.S.; writing—original draft preparation, H.S.; writing—review and editing, H.S.,\\nA.A.Y. and M.K.M.N.; visualization, H.S.; supervision, A.A.Y. and M.K.M.N.; project administration,\\nH.S.

The review aimed to identify current research trends, dosing frameworks, critical variables, and research gaps. Results reveal a steady rise in publications from 2015 (n = 4) to 2022 (n = 18). Feedback loop frameworks and predictive analytics are equally represented (n = 45 each). Critical variables include pH (n = 70), EC (n = 36), total dissolved solids (TDS) (n = 27), nutrient solution volume (NSV) (n = 42), and nutrient solution temperature (NST) (n = 28). The study highlights the need for robust frameworks incorporating advanced dosing frameworks and simultaneous dosing strategies to enhance dosing speed, accuracy, and robustness. A novel framework is proposed to address these gaps by integrating predictive analytics using multiple regression models. This framework aims to improve the dosing speed, accuracy, and robustness of automated hydroponic nutrient dosing systems.

Smart Agriculture Architecture \\n1\\n \\nSmart agriculture has emerged as a major player in modern farming practices. It takes \\n2\\n \\nadvantage of advanced technologies such as the IoT, cloud computing, and machine \\n3\\n \\nlearning to improve crop production, improve resource management, and reduce \\n4\\n \\nenvironmental impact. However, the increasing reliance on digital technologies exposes \\n5\\n \\nsmart agriculture systems to various cybersecurity threats [1,5]. In the Smart agriculture \\n6\\n \\narchitecture, the layers typically include sensor devices, connectivity, data processing and \\n7\\n \\nanalytics, and application layers. Sensor devices collect data on various parameters such \\n8\\n \\nas soil moisture, temperature, and crop health. The connectivity layer enables \\n9\\n \\ncommunication between the sensors and the data processing and analytics layer, which \\n10\\n \\ninvolves cloud-based or edge-based systems for data storage, analysis, and decision-\\n11\\n \\nmaking. The application layer encompasses the user interfaces and applications that \\n12\\n \\nprovide farmers with insights, recommendations, and control over the agricultural \\n13\\n \\nprocesses [1,2, 17]. Figure 3 shows the layers of Smart agriculture architecture. \\n14\\n \\n▪ \\nThe Sensor Layer: This layer is the foundation of the smart farming architecture, \\n15\\n \\nconsisting of various sensors deployed throughout the farm. These sensors monitor \\n16\\n \\nand collect data on environmental conditions, soil moisture levels, temperature, \\n17\\n \\nhumidity, and other relevant parameters. They provide real-time information to the \\n18\\n \\nhigher layers of the architecture for analysis and decision-making. \\n19\\n \\n▪ \\nThe Edge Layer: This layer acts as a vital intermediary between the Sensor Layer and \\n20\\n \\nthe Cloud Layer, performing data processing and analysis locally. Securing this layer \\n21\\n \\nis essential for data protection, system performance, and defense against \\n22\\n \\ncyberattacks. It ensures data integrity, and real-time threat detection, and follows a \\n23\\n \\nlayered security approach. This investment safeguards sensitive data, optimizes \\n24\\n \\noperations, and ensures the long-term success of smart farming. \\n25\\n \\n▪ \\nThe Cloud Layer: This layer represents the centralized computing infrastructure \\n26\\n \\nwhere data from the sensors is stored, processed, and analyzed. It typically involves \\n27\\n \\ncloud-based platforms and services that provide advanced analytics, machine \\n28\\n \\nlearning algorithms, and data storage capabilities. The Cloud Layer enables farmers \\n29\\n \\nto gain insights, make informed decisions, and optimize farming operations based \\n30\\n \\non the collected data. \\n31\\n \\n2.2. Importance of Edge Networks Security \\n32\\n \\nCloud computing in Smart agriculture refers to the utilization of remote servers and \\n33\\n \\ndata centers for storing and processing agricultural data. It offers vast storage capacity and \\n34\\n \\ncomputational power, enabling complex data analysis and resource-intensive \\n35\\n \\napplications[3,14]. However, relying solely on the cloud for all computational tasks may \\n36\\n \\nintroduce potential risks, including the potential for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) \\n37\\n \\nattacks that can disrupt cloud services. On the other hand, edge networks in Smart \\n38\\n \\nagriculture involve deploying computational resources closer to the data source, such as \\n39\\n \\non farm gateways or edge devices. Edge computing brings processing capabilities closer \\n40\\n \\nto the agricultural field, reducing latency and dependence on remote cloud servers.

Machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques are \\n1\\n \\nemployed to detect abnormal patterns in the data and identify potential insider attacks. \\n2\\n \\n4. Methodology \\n3\\n \\nThis section presents or explores the proposed model, describes the framework of the \\n4\\n \\nmodel, explains the data collection process, discusses the preprocessing of data, and details \\n5\\n \\nthe steps involved in model building and training.  \\n6\\n \\n4.1. Overview of the proposed model  \\n7\\n \\nIn this section, we propose a deep learning-based approach for detecting anomalies \\n8\\n \\nin smart agriculture systems on the network edge. The data flow process in securing smart \\n9\\n \\nfarms from DDoS attacks begins at the sensor device within the farm. The sensor device \\n10\\n \\ncollects various data points, such as environmental conditions, crop health metrics, and \\n11\\n \\nlivestock monitoring information. These data points are then transmitted to the network \\n12\\n \\nedge, which serves as the first line of defense against potential DDoS attacks. At the net-\\n13\\n \\nwork edge, the collected data is subjected to deep learning algorithms CNN-LSTM. The \\n14\\n \\nCNN component is responsible for extracting spatial and temporal features from the data, \\n15\\n \\nwhile the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) component handles the sequential analysis, \\n16\\n \\ncapturing dependencies over time. \\n17\\n \\n \\n18\\n \\nThe data is passed through the CNN-LSTM model, which has been trained on a large \\n19\\n \\ndataset of both normal and anomalous farm data. During the classification process, the \\n20\\n \\nmodel compares the input data to the learned patterns and determines whether it is nor-\\n21\\n \\nmal or anomalous. If the data is classified as normal, it is allowed to continue its flow \\n22\\n \\nthrough the network. However, if the data is classified as anomalous, an alert is promptly \\n23\\n \\ngenerated to notify the farm operator or relevant personnel about the potential security \\n24\\n \\nbreach. Simultaneously, as the alert is sent, the anomalous data is blocked from further \\n25\\n \\nprogression within the network. This proactive measure prevents potentially malicious or \\n26\\n \\nharmful data from infiltrating the smart farm system and causing disruptions or damages. \\n27\\n \\nBy employing deep learning algorithms, specifically CNN-LSTM, at the network edge, \\n28\\n \\nthe smart farm system can effectively analyze and classify incoming data in real time. This \\n29\\n \\nproactive approach ensures the security and integrity of the farm's operations by swiftly \\n30\\n \\nidentifying and mitigating potential DDoS attacks. Furthermore, the system's ability to \\n31\\n \\ngenerate alerts enables prompt responses from farm operators or security personnel, al-\\n32\\n \\nlowing them to take appropriate actions to safeguard the smart farm environment. The \\n33\\n \\ndata flow process in securing smart farms from DDoS attacks involves the collection of \\n34\\n \\ndata from the sensor device, passing it through the network edge, and applying deep \\n35\\n \\nlearning techniques, such as CNN-LSTM, for real-time classification. This approach en-\\n36\\n \\nsures that normal data is allowed to proceed while anomalous data triggers an alert and \\n37\\n \\nsubsequent blocking. By implementing such a robust security system, smart farms can \\n38\\n \\noperate with enhanced protection against DDoS attacks, maintaining the integrity and \\n39\\n \\nuninterrupted functionality of their agricultural operations. In conclusion, using this pro-\\n40\\n \\nposed approach at the edge of the network offers several advantages. Firstly, it enables \\n41\\n \\nreal-time analysis and classification of incoming data, allowing for immediate action in \\n42\\n \\ncase of anomalies. Secondly, by applying the model at the network edge, the \\n43\"),\n",

However, hackers use new and innovative tech-\\n4\\n \\nniques to launch cyberattacks. While great attempts to track down these attacks have the \\n5\\n \\nadvantage that they continue to occur in multiple ways to cooperate with other potential \\n6\\n \\nattacks such as DDoS attacks and botnets. This paper proposes an anomaly detection \\n7\\n \\nmodel for IoT networks in smart agriculture using CNN-LSTM. It was performed on two \\n8\\n \\ndifferent datasets, namely IoT-23 and CICDDoS2019. The proposed model achieved high \\n9\\n \\naccuracy for current classification strategies and modern deep learning applications. In \\n10\\n \\nterms of anomaly detection accuracy using the proposed model, the rate is 99.47%, and it \\n11\\n \\ncan be more efficient if applied at the edge of the network. In future work, we will inves-\\n12\\n \\ntigate further anomaly detection using various deep learning methods, such as DBN and \\n13\\n \\nGAN, and compare the results with those obtained with CNN-LSTM. \\n14\\n \\n \\n15\\n \\nFigure 16.

This \\nmethod takes a lot of time to decompose making it prone to \\ndiseases and also requires human effort. To fulfill the demands \\nof the increasing population especially in metropolitan cities, \\nfarmers and commercial plantation companies are forced to \\nuse harmful chemicals to increase production, which affects \\nthe consumers in the long run. Hydroponics is a technique \\nwhich can be used to grow plants without soil. In this \\ntechnique, the plant gets all the required nutrients from the \\nwater solution. An automated dosing system in Hydroponics \\ncan be monitored and controlled with the help of machine \\nlearning algorithms like Deep Neural Networks. We will \\ndiscuss how IoT enables communication between machines \\nand also study the parameters which affect plant growth in the \\nhydroponic system.  \\nKeywords— Hydroponics, Automation, Machine learning, \\nInternet of Things (IoT) \\n \\nI. \\nINTRODUCTION \\nCultivation of plants in soil has been done for a very long time \\non earth. But now with these great technological advancements \\nby humans, we can monitor the growth of plants through \\nmachine learning and can grow them in water due to which the \\nnutrients required by a plant can be given directly from the \\nwater which can be administered depending on how much \\nnutrients can be given to have the desired yield. This type of \\ncultivation of plants is known as Hydroponics.  \\nHydroponics can be useful not just for monitoring and getting \\nthe desired yield but also for future space exploration too. In \\nHydroponics the plants can be without soil that makes it much \\neasier for us to monitor the number of nutrients that should be \\nsupplied for the perfect yield. As soil is not used in this \\ncultivation the risk of crop failure gradually decreases and \\nbeing able to implement machine learning in this system to \\ndetect changes in growth can also decrease the chance of plants \\ngetting disease or abnormality in the growth of the plant. \\nThe major disadvantage of hydroponics is that it can be \\nexpensive to implement it on a very large scale than the \\ntraditional farming methods. But the quality and yield can be \\ncontrolled in hydroponics which can\\'t be done by the traditional \\nfarming methods.                  \\nII.      LITERATURE REVIEW \\nA. Hydroponic Methods for Soilless Production Systems \\nSoilless development addresses a substantial chance for the \\nrural creation area, particularly in regions described by serious \\nsoil corruption and restricted water accessibility. Moreover, this \\nagronomic practice exemplifies an ideal reaction toward a \\nclimate amicable agriculture and a promising instrument in the \\nvision of an overall test regarding food security. Lenord Melvix \\nJ.S.M and Sridevi C in [2] described the procedures required in \\nan effective soilless production system. It is generally realized \\nthat the efficiency and nature of yields filled in hydroponic \\nsystems are notably subject to the degree of the plant nutrients \\nprocurement from the developing medium. Additionally, the \\nsevere reliance on farming practice on water accessibility \\nduring a time of radical environmental changes makes the \\nsituation much more perplexing. In this regard, the chance of \\nabusing surfaces not any longer ripe (because of contamination \\n2021 International Conference on Communication information and Computing Technology (ICCICT) | 978-1-6654-0430-3/21/$31.00 ©2021 IEEE | DOI: 10.1109/ICCICT50803.2021.9510115\\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: ULAKBIM UASL - GAZI UNIV.

Specifically, various substance \\nequilibria should be considered while getting ready nutrients \\narrangements utilizing salts or focused fluid stocks, particularly \\nsolubilization/precipitation harmony. Truth be told, various \\nphysical-chemical parameters can change the nutrients \\naccessibility for plants, the most significant of which are:  \\n(1) Precipitation  \\n(2) Co-precipitation  \\n(3) Complexation  \\nIn this regard, it ought to be featured that the temperature of the \\nnutrient’s arrangement, influencing the synthetic balance in the \\narrangement, may extensively impact these cycles. This is \\nespecially pivotal for territories where the over warming of the \\nnutrients \\narrangement \\nfrequently \\nhappens, \\naffecting \\nadditionally at the physiological degree of harvests. Saltiness \\nincrement could be differentiated by treating the reused water \\nwith proper osmotic systems, including forward and turn \\naround assimilation. \\n \\nB.   IoT in Automated dosing system \\nIoT (Internet of things) is a group of things that can collect data \\nand upload it to the cloud and also can be interacted through the \\nweb. Manav Mehra and Sameer Saxena in [12] proposed an \\nideal \\nmethodology \\nfor \\nimplementing \\nIoT. \\nMaking \\ntechnological advancements in IoT has permitted farmers to \\ncomputerize hydroponic systems. Right pH level, air \\ntemperature, relative humidity, pH level, nutrients level of the \\nwater, and right water system of water is fundamentally \\nsignificant in hydroponics. In this manner, the hydroponic \\nsystem that screens these parameters is important and will \\nguarantee higher achievement and productivity paces of the \\ncultivator. \\n \\nAlong these lines, with this in view, a serious measure of \\nexamination has been conveyed by utilizing IoT for observing \\nand controlling the automated dosing system. It empowers \\nclients to control certain components for topping off, \\nsprinkling, depleting, and a lot more highlights with the \\nassistance of a web application.  \\n \\nThe utilization of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) empowers \\na broadly interconnected registering climate because of a blend \\nof detecting and remote correspondence advancements \\ndispersed over a specific region. The capacity of a wireless \\nsensor to accumulate and hand-off data between hubs in a \\nconstant climate has opened the potential for WSNs to be \\nutilized for a wide cluster of utilizations. \\nC. Smart Hydroponics system \\nT R Sreedevi and M.B Santosh Kumar in [6] defined how an \\nideal smart hydroponic system is categorized. There are four \\ncategories of Smart Hydroponic Systems. \\n1. Automation Level: In this part, the order of \\nhydroponic systems depends on fair and square \\nrobotization. Hydroponic can be considered semi-\\nmechanized and completely computerized. First, we \\nhave to get every single part, and then we have to get \\nevery part to form a hydroponic system that has every \\none of its parts naturally controlled. \\n2. Tasks Automated: In this category, systems are based \\non how much the task is automated. So, smart \\nhydroponics can be established in such a way that it \\ncan help the system by prolonging the system's \\nhardware, providing nutrients to the system, and \\ndemonstrating development identified with crop \\nupkeep, such as moving seedlings from nursery to \\nhydroponic system, supplanting dead plants, and \\nreaping. The last subcategory screens a few or all parts \\nof the system and reports it. \\n3. Automation type: A smart hydroponic system can be \\nconsidered as an embedded system so it comes under \\nthe category of automation. For tuning and changing \\nthe settings of the system, users must be present for \\nkeeping an eye on the behavior of the system. Wireless \\nSensor Networks are also another broad category \\nwhere a single base station is used for controlling the \\nnetwork of the embedded system and users can access \\ndata. To improve the versatility within the web, the \\nIoT based hydroponic system has to be fundamentally \\nassociated with WSNs \\n4. Method of Control: In a smart hydroponic system \\nwhere actuators are included, controlling how the \\nactuators carry on is a vital part of the system. In this \\npaper, the method of control is divided into categories \\ni.e., Proportional Integral and Derivative controller \\nalso known as PID controller.  These controllers are \\ncreated for utilizing control designing methods. \\nArtificial intelligence can be implemented for broad \\ncategories like controlling how the actuators complete \\ntheir tasks without damaging the system. \\n       D.      Estimation of EC and pH \\nIn a hydroponic system, water is used for circulating the \\nnutrient solution to the plants. Stock A and Stock B solutions \\nare the commonly used nutrient solutions in hydroponic \\nsystems. Saaid, M.F., and Fadhil in [7] proposed a methodology \\nfor calculation of EC (Electrical Conductivity) as well as pH in \\nthe hydroponic system. The fertilizer used in this hydroponic \\nsystem is from the Royal Project Foundation which is a \\ncomposing solution. The solutions which are used in this \\nresearch are favorable for small cultivation. The fertilizer which \\nis used must be blended between Stock A and Stock B \\nsolutions.

Stock A \\nand Stock B are consistently monitored and controlled so that \\nplant growth is maintained. Stock A and Stock B with water are \\ntermed as nutrient solutions for the hydroponic system. \\n \\n    E.     Hydroponics a Sustainable Agriculture System \\nHydroponics plant cultivation is considered more efficient as \\nwater consumption is reduced by 90% as a result of which more \\nfruits and vegetables are produced in limited time. It also has a \\nvery minimal carbon footprint as greens are generated locally. \\nAs acknowledged earlier this process is a soilless development \\nprocess hence the consumption of brutal synthetic substances \\nused to treat the soil are limited because the process is itself \\nself-sufficient to generate the required nutrients. This process \\nalso has substantial benefits when compared to traditional \\ncultivation like it involves less space, can be done in vertical \\nformat, involves less human intervention and can be controlled \\nand managed distantly. \\n \\nHanif Fakhrurroja and Syahidul Akbar Mardhotillah in [10] \\nproposed the techniques implemented in the hydroponic \\nsystem. Plants could be developed by flooding their \\nfoundations with the nutrient’s arrangement. In this process the \\nnewly developed plant with a thick stem is upheld with \\nmediums like alluvial soil balls or rock. The arrangement of \\nnutrients can be done through two different processes, either  \\nmatch up the side-effects or play around by mixing miniature \\nnutrients. The plant is supported with a nutrient arrangement \\nthat contains full-scale nutrients like N, K, P, Ca, S, Mg and \\nminiature nutrients like Ni, Cu, Zn, Fe, B, Mn. The retention of \\nthe nutrient content is higher in hydroponic when contrasted \\nwith customary systems. \\n \\nThe NFT system is costlier because of its establishment \\nprocess. To make up for the expense, the system should be able \\nto deliver better quality and quantity of the yield. There is also \\nanother category known as Indoor Hydroponics in which the \\nlight source, temperature and humidity are controlled by the \\nsystem. The technology received in hydroponic farms assists \\nwith estimating the power of the light, electronic conductivity, \\ntemperature and humidity, as well as pH estimation of the \\nnutrient water. \\n                 III.    PROPOSED MODEL \\n1. System Description \\n     As we can observe from the given figure below, we are using \\nthe NFT hydroponics system and applying auto dosing in it. \\nFirstly, we need to have the readings of all factors affecting a \\nplant in the hydroponics system. The factors which affect a \\nplant are the pH, Temperature, and EC of the water in the \\nsystem. For these factors, we are using an Arduino UNO with \\nan EC probe, pH probe, and Temperature and humidity sensor \\nto find out the readings/values to monitor them. We are using a \\nperistaltic pump to supply the nutrient solution to the water \\nreservoir from which the water containing nutrients can be \\nsupplied to our NFT system by a stepper motor. We have also \\ncreated a CAD model of our system which can be seen below. \\n \\n \\nFig.3: Designed Model \\n \\n \\n    Fig.4: CAD Model \\n \\nFig. 5: Circuit diagram of the proposed system \\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: ULAKBIM UASL - GAZI UNIV.

Working \\nWe have programmed the system controller accordingly  it  \\n \\nwill take the values every 5 minutes given by all the sensors \\nincluding an image of the plant which can give the values of \\nRGB in the picture to know how many pixels are showing the \\ncolor of the plant so as to compare it with the last image and \\nfind out the difference in the no. of pixels displaying the plant \\nresulting in finding out the minute differences in the growth of \\nthe plant. These values are taken to the controller and with these \\nvalues, it will see if the system is good for the plant or are there \\nany changes in the system that are required. For Example, if the \\npH value of the system is high in the system which is not good \\nfor the plant, so the controller will initiate the pH motor to pump \\nthe water with less pH in the system to make it a preferable \\nenvironment for the plants to grow. For the system to be able to \\ndo such functions the following set of features should be added \\nto the system. \\n \\na. IoT \\nThe system begins by reading the temperature and humidity \\nfrom DHT11 (Temperature and Humidity Sensor). After that, it \\nis checked if the values exist in the threshold range and if not, \\nthe values are outside the normal range, the system will turn on \\nthe water pump to water the arrangement and decrease the \\ntemperature. At the point when the value comes into the scope \\nof the limit, the system will turn off the water pump. The system \\nat that point checks for pH value and the solenoid valve changes \\nthe pH till it arrives at the set value. All the information \\ngathered in this part can be seen through the web application. \\n \\nb. Machine Learning \\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has created so much that it can \\nprompt a clever control system fit for self-assessment. The \\njoined data from various sensors, through artificial intelligence \\nphilosophies like neural organizations (NNs), can prompt \\nquality characterization of segregated data received from \\nexplicit sensors. The objective for the usage of AI is the \\nimprovement of a system for the plan and preparing \\nparameterization of NNs that would be more complex than the \\nexperimentation technique (trial and error) normally utilized for \\nthese works.  \\nThe NN way to deal with the application was picked \\npredominantly due to the particular idea of hydroponics, and \\nfurthermore for its effortlessness. Hydroponics systems are \\nexceptionally non-direct as a result of the non-linearity of the \\norganic cycles included. Subsequently, assessment techniques \\nwould not be appropriate, predominantly due to their high \\ncomputational requests in the instances of non-linear systems. \\nFurthermore, exact logical models of the hydroponics system \\ndon\\'t exist; accordingly, assessment strategies become \\ninadmissible. From the pattern recognition methods, NNs were \\nviewed as the most fitting since it was concluded that the \\nindependence that artificial intelligence provides for this \\nmethodology \\nis \\ndesirable \\nover \\nsome \\nself-assertive \\ndetermination of complicated numerical tools that other \\nexample acknowledgment procedures would require. The NN \\nmodel needs to recognize the elements of the actual cycle, i.e., \\nthe hydroponic system. All the more explicitly, the model is \\nutilized for the most part for the expectation of state factors as \\nopposed to simulation. All the information is gathered during \\nthe entire developing time of the plant, for example, the 25 days \\nthat the plants are in the pods of the hydroponics system. \\n \\nc. \\nANN Model \\nIn this part of our study, the ANN model consisted of three \\nlayers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The \\nquantity of hidden layers and the quantity of units in the hidden \\nlayer is controlled by trials. The construction of the nets utilized \\nin the study is shown in the following figure. Sources of info \\nare time arrangement information of 5 ecological conditions \\n(sunlight radiation, inside temperature, inside humidity, \\nnutrient, water temperature, and CO2). Outputs are the measure \\nof water and nutrients supplied to hydroponic plants. \\n \\nBackpropagation was utilized as the learning strategy, which is \\nmade out of two systems: feedforward and backpropagation \\nweight training. The information tests were separated into two \\ninformational databases, a training informational database, and \\na testing informational database. A preparation informational \\ndatabase was utilized for preparing the neural organization, and \\na testing informational collection was utilized for assessing the \\nexactness of the recognized model. This kind of model approval \\nis classified as \"cross-validation\". The preparation interaction \\nbrought about weight estimations of the ANN model for the \\nconnection among information and yield boundaries. All \\nfactors were standardized in the range of 0 and 1, utilizing the \\nfixed least and greatest values both in preparing and testing \\nmeasures. \\n \\n \\nFig.6:  Artificial Neural Network Diagram \\n \\n     3.    Limitations \\nWe studied the importance of hydroponic systems but there is \\na certain amount of risk associated with it. \\n \\nThese systems can be vulnerable to power outages which can \\ndisrupt the plant cycles as well as the overall growth.

Also \\nas compared to a conventional hydroponic system, the \\nconsumption of electricity is more in this system. \\n       \\nFor our hydroponics system, we will be using NFT (Nutrient \\nFilm Technique) system and according to it we will be \\nimplementing the auto dosing concept with the help of \\nMechatronics Principles. In the NFT hydroponics system, we \\nwill be having an Arduino with the EC probe, pH probes, \\nTemperature, and humidity sensor to monitor the water and the \\nenvironment (i.e., Polyhouse) of the system and our system will \\ntry to control the environment as well as the water in the system \\nto be suitable for the plant to grow without any human \\nintervention. The nutrients needed by the plant will be provided \\nby the auto-dosing part and the pH of the water will also be \\nmaintained as per the plant's requirement. More details about \\nthe system are given in the below system description. \\nIn order to find out the relationship between the EC and pH for \\nhydroponics, nutrient solution is developed into mathematical \\nequations for adjusted parameters by using linear regression \\nanalysis with their values. From this, we were able to find out \\nthat the nitric acid used in pH adjustment has also affected the \\nEC value in the system. We took down the reading and setting \\nEC value first as it was the indicator of the nutrient. Then we \\ncalculated the number of fertilizers to be given which was done \\nmanually in the quantity of milliliter(ml). \\n \\nIn this research, we implemented a Deep-Water Culture set up \\nto find out the parameters of growth of the plant and the data of \\nEC and pH for a particular type of plant. Also, we discovered \\nthe average number of days required for that particular type of \\nplant to complete its plant cycle. \\n \\n \\nFig.1: Deep Water Culture Setup \\n \\nIn this research, we are using an NFT-based hydroponic system \\nand controlling the EC and pH conditions in the system using \\nfuzzy logic based on the concept of IoT (Internet of Things). It \\nis based on a process consisting of the main tank, 4 control tanks \\n(nutrient solution1, nutrient solution 2, alkaline solution, and \\nacid solution), and a tank where the solutions can be mixed and \\nflowed through the system using flow pumps. We found out \\nthat it takes about 15 minutes to recover for the abnormal range \\nof EC and pH to the suitable range. \\n \\n \\nFig.2: NFT System \\n \\nThis research stated that automatic monitoring and control can \\nbe achieved by using a microcontroller and sensors for \\ndetermining the pH level of water solution in the hydroponic \\nsystem. Change in pH level will result in the system adjusting \\nthe pH level with respect to the suitable solution. In the Deep-\\nWater Culture Hydroponics system, water solution is stored in \\nthe main tank for measuring the pH level with the sensor and \\nalso for undergoing necessary changes. Six methods are \\nimplemented for this technique: study details, hardware \\nidentification, software identification, hardware and software \\nconnections, data collection and analysis, and resolution. \\n  \\nAlso, in the proposed method for the use of EC and pH control \\nsystem, it receives a signal for the Arduino controller. For the \\ncontroller, regression equations were used for EC and pH to \\naffect the increase in values in the system. In the equation, only \\nthree things are required: EC value in the system, pH value in \\nthe system, and the volume of nutrient and acid solutions. \\n \\n                                    IV.    CONCLUSION & FUTURE SCOPE \\nThe main objective of this paper is to propose a model for a \\nhydroponics system with an automated dosing system.  The \\nframework consequently supplies nutrients and furthermore \\nscreens the pH level, water level, and supplement fixation. \\nWhen the observation is done adjustments are made to be \\npossible i.e., it can be controlled accordingly leading to higher \\nproductivity. We are expecting to make a robotized dosing \\nframework with no human mediation necessity with the \\nassistance of a combination of IoT for observing. This model \\nwill save water and manures, and give better yields as compared \\nto traditional farming methods.  \\n \\nAs current innovation patterns in software engineering are \\nthought of, some AI calculations can be pertinent on \\ninformation accumulated from all around the globe by tangible \\nparts with the assistance of IoT. The utilization of AI \\ncalculations can be utilized to upgrade the control system to \\nimprove yield with any climatic conditions.

Introduction\\nGreenhouses and indoor farming systems play an important role in providing fresh food,\\nsuch as fruits and vegetables being high in vitamins and minerals. Greenhouses combine high crop\\nproduction per unit area with a high water use eﬃciency per unit of produce [1], but at the cost\\nof high energy demand [2] and high investments. Greenhouse production is increasing in many\\ncountries worldwide [3] to provide fresh food, preferably produced locally [4]. However, educated and\\nexperienced labour is scarce. In many countries skilled labour to oversee all aspects of greenhouse crop\\nproduction [5] is lacking. The current COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the availability of seasonal\\nlabor is critical for horticulture production [6]. The need of highly educated and experienced crop\\nmanagers has increased, just like the need for more automation and remote control of greenhouses and\\nother farming systems. As farms become larger, or temporarily less accessible, remote monitoring\\nof climate, irrigation, and crop status becomes more important.

Due to climate change, natural resources such as water and (fossil-based) energy\\nare becoming scarcer and improving the resource eﬃciency becomes urgent. A greenhouse grower\\nneeds to make many decisions to simultaneously maximize production and to minimize resources.\\nCrop and greenhouse climate models and/or new intelligent algorithms can help the grower to oversee\\nall information available and to support complex decisions to predict yields and resource use.\\nToday’s high-tech greenhouses are equipped with diﬀerent standard sensors for monitoring light,\\ntemperature, humidity, and CO2 and for actively controlling diﬀerent actuators (e.g., lighting, screening,\\nheating, ventilation, cooling, CO2 dosing, fogging, dehumidiﬁcation, irrigation, and fertilizer dosing)\\nin order to control all growth factors important for crop production at every moment. Today’s growers\\ndetermine the climate, irrigation and crop management strategies based on experience and deﬁnes\\nthe setpoints for climate and irrigation control manually. Actuators then operate based on setpoints\\nconﬁgured in a process computer, while sensors give feedback on measured data for the control loop.\\nAdditional sensors monitoring crop status are able to provide the grower with further information\\non photosynthesis rate [7], sap ﬂow and hydraulic status [8] and leaf temperature [9] to be added\\nto his manual decisions.\\nAutomated greenhouse climate control algorithms have already been\\ndeveloped in the past and are today widely introduced in modern high-tech greenhouses [10–22];\\nhowever, automated control on crop status are still in its infancy.\\nDynamic climate models have been developed [10,18,23–28] which act as a digital twin of the\\nreal greenhouse. An overview of today’s greenhouse climate models is given in a previous study [29].\\nMechanistic models give the opportunity to be used for intelligent decision support on climate control\\nactions. Simulations of past or future scenarios provide information on how a diﬀerent climate control\\nin the past could have improved crop production and which actions are required to reach a certain\\ncrop production goal in the future. These models can also be coupled with intelligent algorithms\\nto automatically determine climate setpoints, an action that is currently performed manually by the\\ngrower. In order to control crop production by an automated algorithm, mechanistic greenhouse\\nclimate and crop models can be used and coupled with a real greenhouse, to send automatically\\ndetermined setpoints via a process computer to control the diﬀerent actuators. Such optimum control\\nexperiments have been conducted with tomato [30,31], sweet pepper [32,33] or pot plants [34] in\\nthe past.\\nThe crop has a central role in every greenhouse production system. Crop management decisions\\nand actions are mostly taken by the greenhouse staﬀ. Manual labor is still required for planting,\\ncrop training, leaf and fruit pruning, and fruit harvesting in greenhouses with high-wire vegetable\\nproduction. While manual labor requirement is high, crop management decisions can be supported.\\nSince experienced and well-trained crop managers are scarce, crop simulation models can play a role\\nin decision making. An overview of greenhouse crop models and modelling approaches are given in\\nother studies [35–43]. Crop models can be used as virtual representations of reality [44]. They can\\nbe used to simulate diﬀerent growing conditions and crop management strategies and predict crop\\ndevelopment and yield, and fruit quality. Crop models can help to understand the crop behavior under\\ndiﬀerent growing conditions and can support the grower in making decisions.\\nAI algorithms are widely used in horticultural research and have recently been implemented\\nin practice. Main application ﬁelds are plant stress detection [45], fruit detection or counting [46],\\npest, disease, or weed detection [47–49], yield prediction or harvesting [50,51]. Diﬀerent camera and\\nspectroscopy systems in diﬀerent spectral ranges are used for detection, diﬀerent computer vision\\nand machine learning algorithms are used for analysis. However, the use of AI for greenhouse crop\\nproduction control is still limited [52–57]. Recently a benchmark experiment has been conducted to\\nuse artiﬁcial intelligent (AI) algorithms to optimize net proﬁt of a cucumber crop in a greenhouse\\nexperiment during the ﬁrst Autonomous Greenhouse Challenge in 2018. In that experiment the winning\\nAI algorithm outperformed the human decisions of experienced growers [58]. Crop production (class A:'),\n",

A diﬀerent crop had to be grown, cherry tomatoes require\\nmore complex control since it can be controlled not only on yield but also on product quality. While in\\nthe ﬁrst experiment the crop was grown during a summer–autumn growing season, in this second\\nexperiment the crop was grown during winter–spring–summer. Other challenges were added such as\\nno ﬁxed product prices, but prices were dependent on fruit quality and fruit quality was dependent on\\nnutrient control, nutrient control was an oﬀtrade of yield (more income but lower prices) and product\\nquality (high prices but lower yield). Comparable to the ﬁrst experiment [58], ﬁve multi-disciplinary\\ninternational teams automatically controlled their own greenhouse compartment remotely, a sixth\\nteam of local experienced human reference growers acted as manually controlled reference. The goal\\nof the experiment was to maximize net proﬁt by realizing high yield and product prices and minimize\\nresource use and costs.\\nThe aim of this paper is to describe the results of the experiment in terms of net proﬁt, yields\\nand resource use, to analyze diﬀerent climate and crop management strategies, to explain the results\\nwith the help of a digital twin model of a virtual greenhouse, and to detect possible improvements\\nof automatic control for the future.\\nThe experiment provided a valuable public dataset which\\ncan be used for future AI training purposes and which can be found at Supplementary Materials:\\nhttps://doi.org/10.4121/uuid:88d22c60-21b3-4ea8-90db-20249a5be2a7.\\n2.

For control of natural light and energy saving two types of inside moveable screens\\n(LUXOUS 1547 D FR energy screen and OBSCURA 9950 FR W light blocking screen, Ludvig Svensson,\\nSweden) were present. For temperature control a rail pipe heating system on the ﬂoor and a pipe heating\\nsystem at crop height (peak capacity 180 and 30 W/m2, respectively) were installed, both controllable\\nindependently. Next to that, a continuous roof ventilation (ventilation area of 0.3 m2 opening per m2\\ngreenhouse), equipped with anti-thrips netting was available and a fogging system (maximum capacity\\nof 330 g/m2/h), and CO2 supply (maximum capacity 15 g/m2/h) were mounted.

Teams took over remote control on 20 December 2019. The crop was grown in a high-wire\\ngrowing system. Initial plant density and stem density were determined by the teams in advance and\\nvaried between 2.6 and 4.0 stems/m2, all teams opted for a 2-stem young plant. The reference started\\nwith 4.0 stems/m2. Changes in stem density during the cropping period were diﬀerent for the teams in\\ntime. The ﬁrst harvest was on 13 February 2020, and the last harvest was for all teams set to 29 May\\n2020. Based on this last harvest date, the date of topping (removal of head of the crop) had to be chosen\\nby the teams and diﬀered from 16 to 30 April 2020. The crop in the reference compartment was topped\\non 16 April 2020.\\nTeams sent weekly instructions with regards to stem density, and fruit and leaf pruning in the\\ntop of the canopy to the greenhouse staﬀ. Stem density over time ranged from 2.6 to 8.0 stems/m2.\\nFruit pruning strategies led to a diﬀerent maximum plant load of 500 to 800 fruits/m2. Crop parameters\\nsuch as stem elongation (cm per week), stem thickness (mm), fruit growth period (d), and truss\\nformation rate (#truss/week) were manually measured per week on 10 sample plants. The stem\\nthickness refers to the thickness of the stem just below the highest ﬂowering cluster near the plant\\ntop. The fruit growth period refers to the time between the day that the ﬁrst fruits on the cluster\\nclearly start to grow and the day of harvest of the cluster. Plant load (#fruits/m2) was estimated from\\nstem density, numbers of new and harvested trusses, and number of fruits per new truss, and was\\nweekly shared with the teams. Harvest was performed per truss, approximately ﬁve times every two\\nweeks. Harvest data on number of harvested trusses (#/m2) and fresh fruit weight (kg/m2) of class\\nA, were obtained manually by the greenhouse staﬀ. Additionally, fruit quality analyses were carried\\nout in the laboratory.

Economics\\nNet proﬁt was calculated based on income minus costs. The income was determined from the kg\\ntomato fruits harvested x price per kg fruits and fruit quality. The price depended on fruit quality,\\nnamely its Brix value, and on the season (Figure A1). The costs were based on the operational costs\\nrelated to resources used by the teams during the experiment.

Performance Analysis\\nTeams operated the diﬀerent greenhouse compartments using their own AI algorithms.\\nThe outcome were diﬀerent management strategies for climate, irrigation, and crop, aﬀecting crop\\nyields, product qualities and resource use eﬃciencies, and thus income, costs, and net proﬁt.\\nIn a performance analysis the realized results of the real greenhouse crop production in diﬀerent\\ncompartments were compared with a greenhouse climate and crop simulation model, a virtual\\ngreenhouse crop production (digital twin). With the availability of this digital twin of the real\\ngreenhouse, a detailed analysis can be performed to better understand the roles of diﬀerent growth\\nfactors such as light, temperature, CO2 etc.\\nThe virtual greenhouse crop production model consisted of a combination of a dynamic greenhouse\\nclimate model KASPRO [24] and a tomato crop model INTKAM [43]. The combined model assumes\\nadequate supply of water and nutrients and ignores the presence and eﬀects of pests and diseases.\\nThe KASPRO model computes the greenhouse climate as a function of the realized outside weather\\nconditions in our experiment and the realized greenhouse climate control settings in our greenhouse\\nwith the real parameters of construction and equipment. The model processes these control settings by\\na control algorithm comparable to the ones used in the real greenhouses. The climate model output\\nconsists of various climate parameters, such as light intensity, temperature, CO2 concentration and air\\nhumidity. This output is then used as input for the tomato crop model INTKAM [43], which computes\\ndaily gross photosynthesis from the sum of hourly photosynthesis rates. The hourly photosynthesis\\nrates are the outcome of a dynamic crop architecture (leaf area index and plant load) under the\\ndynamic climate conditions. Crop photosynthesis minus crop dissimilation results in the amount of\\ncarbohydrates produced. The daily amount of carbohydrates is then partitioned over the growing\\norgans (roots, stems, leaves, fruits) according to their relative potential growth rates. Dry matter\\nfraction and fresh organ weights are calculated in a next step. In a last step, the harvest moment of\\nindividual fruits is determined on its physiological fruit age [60], tomato yield results. The net proﬁt is\\ncomputed as described above.\\nThe digital twin was used to calculate the tomato crop yield of each compartment, while using the\\nreal greenhouse construction, the real equipment, the real weather conditions and the realized climate\\nand crop management strategies in the individual compartment as inputs. The calculated output was\\nthe predicted fresh yield (kg/m2). The crop model was appropriately calibrated. With this calibrated\\ndigital twin of the greenhouse, the eﬀects of changes in light, air temperature and CO2 control strategies\\non fresh production were investigated for each compartment of the experiment. The inﬂuence of light\\navailability was investigated by increasing or decreasing the number of lighting hours by max 3 h per\\nday, not changing the applied light intensity. CO2 dosing capacity was varied from 50 to 200 kg/ha/h,\\nwhile simultaneously changing the setpoint of CO2 concentration from −100 to +50 ppm compared\\nto the applied strategy. Temperature setpoints were changed by −2 to 2 ◦C, compared to the applied\\nstrategy. Eﬀects on net proﬁt were investigated.'),\n",

While some compartments showed a relatively\\nstable temperature regime throughout the season (301, 303, and 304), others showed higher temperatures\\nduring the ﬁrst weeks, then a moderate level and a large increase at the end (305 and 306), probably to\\naccelerate development early in the season and fasten fruit ripening at the end of the season. While 305\\nand 306 appeared to apply the same concept, temperatures of 305 were lower than those of 306.\\nDespite the high temperature regimes applied in 306 the team reached higher heat use eﬃciency\\n(Table 2). This was achieved by allowing a high humidity and limit ventilation where possible (data\\nnot shown). The reference growers (303) applied relatively high temperatures throughout the season,\\nwhich also resulted in the highest heating use (Figure 4; Table 2).\\nFigure 3.

Performance Analysis\\nThe availability of the well validated greenhouse climate and crop models KASPRO-INTKAM;\\nthus, the availability of a digital twin of the greenhouse tomato production, allowed the use of the\\nmodels for a quantitative performance analysis. After automated distillation of important climate\\nstrategies (temperature, CO2, and lighting) from the existing realized data, simulation results of\\nimportant climate parameters, such as temperature (Figure A6), CO2 (Figure A7) and light (Figure A8)\\nwere compared with realized climate parameters. Data shows that simulated and realized results\\nare comparable. After appropriate calibration of the crop model, simulated fresh weight of harvest\\n(Figure A9) was compared to realized crop production. Data shows that the simulated and realized\\nresults are comparable during the largest part of the harvest period. However, Figure A9 shows that the\\nﬁnal boost in the last two weeks after topping was not captured. Further improvements on the model\\nwould be needed for a closer match in these last weeks by reﬁnements on the dry matter partitioning\\nbetween generative and vegetative parts and the gradual increase of the ripening speed after removal\\nof the plant apex. A more in-depth analysis of the performance during this period was not conducted.\\nAfter this model validation, a performance analysis was carried out, analyzing the eﬀects of\\nchanges in control strategies on fresh production and net proﬁt for each compartment of the experiment.\\nAs crop growth is predominantly aﬀected by the availability of light and CO2 and the greenhouse has\\nto be at a favorable temperature to allow a proper growth and development of the crop, a sensitivity\\nanalysis was carried out on changes in these three major parameters. Data shown on net proﬁt only.\\nFigure 19 shows the simulated eﬀect of variations in CO2-supply on net proﬁt with respect to\\nthe strategy as applied by the diﬀerent teams. Each team has controlled the CO2-conentration in a\\ndiﬀerent way resulting in a range of CO2 dosing from 7.2 kg/m2 for compartment 303 to 11.7 kg/m2 for\\ncompartment 301. The sensitivity was evaluated by changing the CO2 setpoint by −100 to +50 ppm,\\nwhile also changing the dosing capacity from 50 to 200 kg/ha/h. This resulted in a changed CO2 supply\\n(kg). The lowest CO2 setpoints, reduced the production for some teams substantially, up to 0.72 kg/m2,\\nrepresenting a value of €1.80 per m2 for team 301. At a CO2 price of €0.08 per kg it is clear that the\\nreduction of income is far more than the savings on CO2, so reduction of CO2-dosing is not beneﬁcial\\nfor proﬁtability. When increasing CO2 dosing, there is some beneﬁt to gain, but the beneﬁt is small for\\nmost teams, which show that the teams were operating at quite an optimal strategy.\\nFigure 20 shows the eﬀect of variations in temperature on net proﬁt with respect to the strategy\\nas applied by the diﬀerent teams. Temperature was varied by −2 to 2 ◦C, compared to the applied\\nstrategy. This analysis shows that a decrease may save some on heating, but the lowered production\\nleads to a decreased net proﬁt. Increase of the temperature was simulated to be proﬁtable although the\\nincrement in proﬁt was again small. It can therefore be concluded that according to the simulation\\nmodel, with changes in temperature potential gains were small.\\nFinally, Figure 21 shows the eﬀect of variations in artiﬁcial lighting on net proﬁt with respect to\\nthe strategy as applied by the diﬀerent teams. The inﬂuence of light availability was investigated by\\nincreasing or decreasing the number of lighting hours by max 3 h per day, not changing the applied\\nlight intensity. An increase of lighting will result in higher electricity costs, higher production, and a\\nlittle less cost for heating. A decrease of the number of lighting hours will generally do the opposite.\\nIt can be observed that the response of net proﬁt on the application of light is much stronger than the'),\n",

Cropping Strategy\\nProﬁtable tomato production implies the production of the maximum number of fruits of a certain\\nquality while using a rational amount of resources. The product quality is determined by the size\\n(too small fruits have a lower price) and Brix (fruits with higher Brix have a higher price, depending on\\nseason). With the choices in cultivation, growers aim on realizing a certain fruit size. As fruit size is\\nnegatively correlated to the number of fruits (per stem, per m2), reaching the target fruit size means\\nthat the grower has to manage the number of fruits produced. The number of fruits is determined by\\nthe number of trusses per stem, the number of fruits per truss and the stem density. In order to obtain\\nthe desired total number of fruits, the number of fruits per stem is to a certain extent interchangeable\\nwith stem density. However, given the fact that in this challenge the fruits were harvested and sold\\nper cluster, the maximum number of fruits per cluster is constrained. This was done in order to\\nlimit the diﬀerence in maturity of the consecutive fruits within a cluster [60]. It limits the number of\\nfruits on a truss to maximal 16 for single, and 20 for split trusses. Realized data on crop performance\\n(Figures 14–16; Table 1) show that some teams opted for a large number of fruits and a lower number\\nof stems per m2, which saved on labor, where other teams applied a higher stem density and a lower\\nnumber of fruits per cluster, which promoted evenly ripened clusters. It could be concluded that these\\nare important parameters for optimization. Automated recording of relevant crop data is needed in\\nthe future to allow automated optimization.\\nIt was assumed that fertigation would have an eﬀect on fruit quality, and therewith on proﬁtability.\\nWhereas it is often assumed that the EC in the root zone has a positive eﬀect on the Brix value of the\\ntomato fruits [61], for this cherry tomato variety a good correlation could not be found. Figure 12 shows\\nthe correlation of measured Brix and average EC in the drain value during the 35 days prior to the\\nharvest, which, for ease of computation, was considered as the fruit growth period. Combining all data,\\nthere was no eﬀect of the EC in the drain on the Brix, which was on average 8.7. Similarly, there was\\nno eﬀect of the EC in the drain on the fruit dry matter content, which was in average 9.0% (data not\\nshown). A parallel peak in EC and Brix values was observed halfway the harvest period for 305 but\\nthis was not a trend as other compartments also showed periods with a notably higher EC that did not\\nresult in an increased Brix. It could be concluded that the data and available knowledge on the used\\ncherry tomato variety do not allow for automated optimization yet.\\nIn the performance analysis, simulations with the virtual greenhouse, and crop model were carried\\nout to analyze the eﬀect of diﬀerent growth factors on crop production and net proﬁt. Cumulative fresh\\nproduction of cherry tomato could be well parameterized and simulated, apart from the under-estimated\\nproduction at the end of the growing cycle that was observed for all compartments.

However, when the CO2 dosing was strongly\\nreduced a clear reduction in production and net proﬁt could be observed. In general, increasing CO2\\ndosing compared to the levels already applied by the teams hardly increased net proﬁt. High levels of\\nCO2 dosage during summer did not result in high air CO2 concentration, and therefore not in increased\\nproduction, because window opening led to loss of the supplemented CO2. In winter, when windows\\nare closed, CO2 dosage does in general lead to elevated air CO2 concentration and production increase.\\nThe limitations then are set by the crop that knows limits to the amount of CO2 it can absorb and\\nconvert into carbohydrates. However, teams seem to have used high enough CO2 concentrations\\n(Figure 19). It could be concluded that at increased dosing capacities and CO2 setpoints, the additional\\nrevenue of the crop hardly exceeded the additional costs for CO2 beyond the realized CO2 strategies\\napplied in the experiment. However, the control of CO2 clearly oﬀers possibilities for autonomous\\ncontrol to optimize CO2 dosage in relation to ventilation management (costs) versus CO2 concentration\\nand crop production (income).\\nSimulations with the virtual greenhouse and crop model were also carried out to study the eﬀect\\nof temperature on crop production and net proﬁt. The eﬀect of temperature on crop growth and\\ndevelopment has a number of aspects and is therefore complex. With regards to photosynthesis,\\nthe eﬀect temperature is small within moderate ranges (18–24 ◦C) [62], which implies that gross\\ncarbohydrate production will not change much. Temperature has a much stronger eﬀect on maintenance\\nrespiration [63], so, increased temperature leads to reduced carbohydrate availability for growth.\\nThere is also an eﬀect on the number of trusses developed. This is assumed to be linear [36], which was\\nconﬁrmed in the current experiment. Within the temperature ranges applied in this project, the truss\\nformation rate varied from 1.1 cluster per week at 19◦C diurnal average temperature to 1.47 cluster\\nper week at 24 ◦C diurnal average temperature (data not shown). If other growth factors stay the\\nsame, this would lead to more, but smaller fruits. Since smaller fruits might reduce the product\\nprice, a good grower balances temperature (=number of trusses formed), number of fruits per truss\\nand number of stems per m2 in such a way that the maximum number of fruits with a satisfying\\nfruit weight is produced. Stem density is a strategic decision that can be changed only sporadically\\nduring the growing season, number of fruits per truss can be modiﬁed weekly, and temperature can\\nbe controlled at any moment; although, the response of the tomato crop in terms of production is\\nbased on the temperature management over at least several days or one week. It could be concluded\\nthat the temperature strategy oﬀers clear opportunities for autonomous control. Since temperature\\nmanagement inﬂuences the number of trusses formed through truss formation rate and fruit ripening\\ntime over time, camera systems could automatically detect these parameters. The other two parameters,\\nnumber of fruits per truss and the number of stems per m2, can be optimized by, e.g., sensors or model\\nestimates of the photosynthetic capacity of the crop.\\nSimulations with the virtual greenhouse and crop model were also carried out to study the eﬀect\\nof lighting strategies on crop production and net proﬁt. There is a strong diﬀerence between the\\ninstantaneous eﬀect and the integrated daily eﬀect of light on crop photosynthesis. As long as light is\\nthe limiting factor, its increase will cause a higher photosynthesis rate. However, even if instantaneous\\nphotosynthesis has reached on optimum, the integrated daily value will change if the light period\\nis lengthened. This is the reason why more light caused more simulated growth and production\\n(Figure 21). However, the response is not the same during the entire growing season. It is assumed that\\njuvenile plants are sink limited in their growth, meaning that there are more carbohydrates produced\\nthan the small plants can process, which has also been incorporated in the crop simulation model.\\nIncrease of light in this phase only adds to costs, not to extra growth. There follows a transition phase\\nduring which growth changes from sink to source limited growth. An adult crop knows a source\\nlimited growth, and extra artiﬁcial lighting during this phase was proved to be ﬁnancially proﬁtable.'),\n",

Sensors, Algorithms, and Control\\nGreenhouses are highly non-linear, complex, multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) systems [64].\\nThe underlying production processes present diﬀerences in response times of the variables involved.\\nGreenhouse climate and crop photosynthesis respond rapidly to changes in control and external\\ninputs, whereas crop growth and production respond comparatively slow to changes in control [17].\\nWhereas greenhouse climate information is available with many datapoints, crop related information\\nis sparsely available. However, the performance of machine learning algorithms (e.g. deep learning,\\nneural networks), highly depends on the diversity and size of training data [65].\\nPrior to the start of the greenhouse crop experiment, teams could explore, build, and train algorithms\\nusing a virtual greenhouse environment emulated by the available climate-crop models [24,43]. The use\\nof synthetic training datasets has been shown to be very useful in earlier applications, when real-world\\ndata are not quantitatively and qualitatively suﬃcient for training purposes [51,66]. In the real growing\\nexperiment, contextually relevant data was collected via standard sensors, next to that data was\\ncollected by teams with additional sensors of their preference (see Section 2.3) to improve and increase\\nthe eﬃciency and robustness of their algorithms. During this exploration phase prior to the start of the\\nexperiment, teams should have accounted for such a systems’ architecture that would not be hampered\\nby the data availability during the transition from the virtual to actual growing environment. In other\\nwords, teams that selected model-based control using the available models, should have trained their\\nalgorithms with parameters/data that they would be able to monitor in the greenhouse experiment.\\nAdditional sensors of the teams varied from low-cost tailor made, to novel sensors for climate\\nand crop monitoring. Natural and mechanical ventilated climate sensors for temperature, humidity,\\nand CO2 as well as NIR and PAR sensors were placed by teams on diﬀerent heights, to monitor\\nclimate homogeneity. Spatial mapping of the parameters supported algorithms of the teams on climate\\ncontrol decisions (ventilation, CO2 dosage, lighting strategy) and crop management (stem density, fruit\\npruning). The digital images of optical low- and high- resolution camera systems RGB, and thermal\\ncameras allowed teams to remotely and visually inspect crop growth and well-being, monitor the\\nnumber and ripening of the fruits as well as the temperature of the leaves at diﬀerent crop heights.\\nWide-view cameras enabled the control of operations of actuators (e.g. lamps on/oﬀ, screen opening).\\nSome teams labelled the collected imagery datasets based on expert knowledge and used them for\\nphenotyping certain crop traits. In literature, several authors focused on spatial mapping of climate\\nor digital image data for greenhouse growing crops [67–72]. Here are still many opportunities for\\nautomated computer vision analysis and automated control in the future. Mechanical sensors collected\\ndirect feedback from sampled plants. Weighing gutters and crop load cells allowed real-time monitoring\\nof the crop and plant weight. Such data were potentially used by the teams in ﬁnding correlations\\nbetween crop and plant weight changes under diﬀerent climate, irrigation and crop management\\ndecisions that could support their algorithms. Furthermore sap-ﬂow and stem diameter sensors on\\nﬁxed positions allowed automated monitoring of ﬂuid transport and stem diameter. The information\\nwas used by some teams for deﬁning their heating temperature and irrigation strategies as previous\\nresearch [73] reported associations of leaf temperature, stem and sap ﬂow measurements with the\\nwater status of the plant and drought stress.\\nEach team followed a diﬀerent approach for determining their strategies and controls of the\\ngreenhouse climate and crop. However, the majority decided to breakdown the system into long-\\nand short-term decisions and controls. The decision-making scheme of team 306 consisted of three\\nmanagerial levels: strategic, tactical, and operational. The strategic level aimed at deﬁning their crop'),\n",

Farms are becoming larger and greenhouse growers need to make complex decisions to maximize production and minimize resource use while meeting market requirements. However, highly skilled labor is increasingly lacking in the greenhouse sector. Moreover, extreme events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can make farms temporarily less accessible. This highlights the need for more autonomous and remote-control strategies for greenhouse production. This paper describes and analyzes the results of the second “Autonomous Greenhouse Challenge”. In this challenge, an experiment was conducted in six high-tech greenhouse compartments during a period of six months of cherry tomato growing. The primary goal of the greenhouse operation was to maximize net profit, by controlling the greenhouse climate and crop with AI techniques. Five international teams with backgrounds in AI and horticulture were challenged in a competition to operate their own compartment remotely. They developed intelligent algorithms and use sensor data to determine climate setpoints and crop management strategy. All AI supported teams outperformed a human-operated greenhouse that served as reference. From the results obtained by the teams and from the analysis of the different climate-crop strategies, it was possible to detect challenges and opportunities for the future implementation of remote-control systems in greenhouse production.', 'keywords': 'artificial intelligence; sensors; resource use efficiency; tomato yield; indoor farming; autonomous greenhouses; climate control; irrigation control; remote control; data driven growing', 'moddate': '2020-11-26T15:17:54+08:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20201126151754+08'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20201111151925+08'00'\", 'page': 29}, page_content='Sensors 2020, 20, 6430\\n30 of 30\\n73.\\nVermeulen, K.; Steppe, K.; Linh, N.S.; Lemeur, R.; De Backer, L.; Bleyaert, P.; Berckmans, D.
