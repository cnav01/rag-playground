LITERATURE REVIEW \\n2.1  Importance of Predictive Maintenance in Smart Grids: \\nThe implementation of predictive maintenance in smart grids has emerged as a pivotal strategy to \\nenhance grid reliability, optimize operational efficiency, and mitigate the challenges posed by the ever -\\nevolving energy landscape [7]. Traditionally, the energy industry relied on reactive maintenance practices, \\nwhere equipment repairs were performed only after failures occurred. However, with the transformation of \\nthe power grid into a dynamic and interconnected ecosystem , traditional maintenance approaches proved \\ninadequate in meeting the demands of modern energy management [1,3]. \\n2.1.1  Proactive Approach to Maintenance: \\nPredictive maintenance introduces a proactive approach to equipment upkeep in smart grids. By \\nharnessing the power of data analytics and machine learning algorithms, utilities can anticipate potential \\nequipment failures and irregularities before they manifest as major issues. This proactive stance empowers \\nutilities to address maintenance needs in a timely manner, preventing catastrophic failures and costly \\nunplanned downtime [9]. \\n2.1.2  Minimizing Operational Disruptions: \\nUnplanned downtime can have significant financial implications for utilities and consumers alike. \\nThrough anomaly detection in I oT sensor data, predictive maintenance can identify potential equipment \\nmalfunctions early, allowing utilities to schedule maintenance activities during periods of low demand or \\nplanned maintenance windows. This minimizes the impact on operations and ensur es uninterrupted energy \\nsupply to consumers [4]. \\n2.1.3  Asset Performance Optimization: \\nPredictive maintenance enables utilities to optimize the performance of critical assets in the smart \\ngrid infrastructure. By detecting anomalies and deviations in senso r data, utilities can pinpoint \\nunderperforming equipment and take proactive measures to rectify issues. This approach not only extends \\nthe lifespan of assets but also ensures their optimal performance, contributing to increased grid efficiency \\nand cost savings [3]. \\n2.1.4  Resource Allocation Efficiency: \\nTraditional maintenance practices often involve the periodic inspection of all equipment, leading to \\ninefficient resource allocation. With predictive maintenance, resources can be allocated strategically to \\naddress the maintenance needs of specific assets, optimizing the utilization of labor, time, and materials. This \\nresults in reduced maintenance costs and maximized operational efficiency [9]. \\n2.1.5  Enhanced Grid Resilience: \\nIn an era of increased climate change-related events and extreme weather conditions, maintaining a \\nresilient and robust smart grid infrastructure is of paramount importance. Predictive maintenance allows \\nutilities to identify potential vulnerabilities in the grid and take preventive act ions to enhance its resilience \\nagainst adverse events [4,9]. \\n2.1.6  Customer Satisfaction and Trust: \\nBy proactively addressing equipment failures and minimizing disruptions, predictive maintenance \\nenhances customer satisfaction and fosters consumer trust in the reliability of the smart grid. Ensuring \\nconsistent and uninterrupted energy supply contributes to a positive customer experience and reinforces the \\nutility's reputation as a reliable energy provider  [3,4,9].Predictive maintenance in smart grids, fac ilitated by \\nanomaly detection in IoT sensor data using machine learning techniques, plays a pivotal role in \\nrevolutionizing maintenance practices in the energy sector. This proactive and data -driven approach \\nempowers utilities to optimize asset performance , reduce operational costs, and ensure the seamless and \\nreliable delivery of energy to consumers. Embracing predictive maintenance positions utilities at the \\nforefront of the energy transition, driving sustainable and resilient smart grid infrastructures for the future.\"),\n",

In  the \\ncontext of smart grids, where IoT devices are extensively deployed to monitor and control various aspects of \\nthe electrical grid, anomaly detection plays a vital role in ensuring the reliability and efficiency of the system \\n[2]. The continuous stream of data generated by IoT sensors provides valuable insights into the grid's health \\nand performance. However, amidst the vast volume of sensor data, anomalies or deviations from normal \\npatterns may occur, signaling potential equipment malfunctions, cybersec urity threats, or irregularities in \\npower consumption [5].The primary goal of anomaly detection in IoT sensor data within smart grids is to \\nidentify these deviations and outliers, allowing for the early detection of equipment failures and performance \\nirregularities. Traditional rule-based methods may fall short in handling the complexities and dynamic nature \\nof smart grid data. As a result, the integration of advanced machine-learning techniques has become \\nincreasingly popular for accurate and real -time anomaly detection [5].Machine learning algorithms offer the \\ncapability to analyze large -scale sensor data in real -time, enabling the timely identification of abnormal \\nbehavior. Techniques such as Isolation Forest, One -Class SVM, Autoencoders, and Random Fores t are \\nemployed to discern patterns that deviate significantly from the expected normal behavior. \\n These algorithms learn from historical data and build models that can generalize and identify new \\nanomalies [2].The importance of anomaly detection in IoT sen sor data is multifaceted. Firstly, it enables \\nproactive maintenance strategies, as anomalies can serve as early indicators of potential equipment failures. \\nBy addressing maintenance needs before a failure occurs, utilities can minimize downtime and reduce \\noperational disruptions, leading to significant cost savings. Secondly, anomaly detection supports enhanced \\nasset performance optimization, as deviations in sensor data can be indicative of underperforming equipment \\n[5]. By rectifying these issues promptly , utilities can ensure optimal asset utilization and extend equipment \\nlifespans.Moreover, anomaly detection enhances the resilience and reliability of the smart grid. By \\nidentifying potential vulnerabilities and irregularities, utilities can take preventiv e measures to safeguard the \\ngrid against cyberattacks, environmental stresses, and extreme weather events. This proactive stance in grid \\nmanagement enhances consumer trust and satisfaction by ensuring uninterrupted energy supply and a \\npositive customer exp erience. Anomaly detection in IoT sensor data is a critical enabler of predictive \\nmaintenance strategies within smart grids. By leveraging machine learning techniques, utilities can unlock \\nthe full potential of their data to detect anomalies in real -time a nd make informed decisions about \\nmaintenance and asset management. As the energy sector continues to evolve, anomaly detection will remain \\na cornerstone in the quest for sustainable, efficient, and resilient smart grid infrastructures. \\n2.3  Machine Learning Techniques for Anomaly Detection: \\nIn the domain of the Internet of Things (IoT), an anomaly refers to any data measurement that \\nexhibits substantial deviation from the typical set of sensed data. Depending on their nature, three distinct \\ncategories of anomalies can be observed within IoT -based networks: Errors, Events, and Malicious Attacks  \\n[5].

The following are some prominent machine-learning techniques employed in anomaly detection \\nwithin smart grids: \\n2.3.1  Isolation Forest: \\nThe Isolation Forest algorithm , depicted in Fig. 2 below  is an unsupervised learning technique that \\nfocuses on isolating anomalies within data points. It constructs a binary tree -based partitioning of the data, \\naiming to isolate anomalies into small, easily detectable regions. Anomalies are typically isolated faster than \\nnormal data points, enabling quick and efficient anomaly detection in large datasets. This algorithm works \\nwell with high -dimensional data and requires minimal assumptions about the under lying data distribution  \\n[11]. \\n \\nFig 2.

[11] \\n2.3.2  One-Class SVM (Support Vector Machine): \\nOne-Class SVM is a well -established machine learning algorithm designed specifically for anomaly \\ndetection in the absence of labeled anomaly samples. It separates normal data from potential anomalies by \\nfinding the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin around the normal data points. One -Class SVM is \\nparticularly useful when only normal data is available fo r model training, making it suitable for scenarios \\nwhere labeled anomaly data may be scarce  [12]. In the context of Support Vector Machine (SVM), the \\noptimal hyperplane, also known as the maximal margin, can be precisely defined using mathematical and \\ngeometric principles. This hyperplane represents a decision boundary that aims to minimize misclassification \\nerrors encountered during the training phase (refer to Figure 3 for visual representation) [14]. \\n \\nFig 3.

Performance Metrics: \\nSeveral performance metrics are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the anomaly detection models. \\nPrecision measures the proportion of true anomalies among all detected anomalies, while recall (or \\nsensitivity) quantifies the proportion of true anomalies correctly identified by the model. The F1 -score, a \\nharmonic mean of precision and recall, provides a balanced assessment of the model's performance. \\nAdditionally, the Receiver Operating Characteristic ( ROC) curve is utilized to assess the model's ability to \\ntradeoff between a true positive rate and a false positive rate at various classification thresholds [18]. \\n2.4.2  Cross-Validation: \\nCross-validation can be employed to assess the model's generalization ability and robustness. The \\ndataset in this case is partitioned into multiple subsets (folds), with each fold used as both training and testing \\ndata. The process is repeated several times, and the average perf ormance metrics are calculated. Cross -\\nvalidation can help to detect overfitting or underfitting issues and ensures that the models perform well on \\nunseen data [19]. \\n2.4.3.  Hyperparameter Tuning: \\nMachine learning algorithms often have hyperparameters that need to be set before training. \\nHyperparameter tuning involves systematically searching through different combinations of hyperparameters \\nto find the configuration that yields the best performance. Techniques such as grid search or random search \\ncan be employed to identify the optimal hyperparameter values, further improving the model's performance  \\n[20]. \\n2.4.4  Out-of-Sample Testing: \\nOnce the optimal anomaly detection model is selected and fine -tuned, it is subjected to out -of-\\nsample testing on a separate v alidation dataset that the model has not seen during training. This validation \\ndataset represents real -world scenarios and ensures that the model's performance remains consistent and \\nreliable on unseen data [21]. \\n2.4.5  Model Deployment and Monitoring: \\nAfter thorough performance evaluation and model selection, the final anomaly detection model \\nshould be deployed in the smart grid infrastructure for real -time monitoring. Continuous monitoring and \\nperiodic re-evaluation of the model's performance ensure th at it continues to deliver accurate and reliable \\nanomaly detection results over time [22].Performance evaluation and model selection are critical components \\nof implementing anomaly detection in IoT sensor data for predictive maintenance in smart grids. Rig orous \\nevaluation of machine learning models enables utilities to identify the most effective anomaly detection \\napproach, ensuring the early identification of equipment malfunctions, optimized maintenance planning, and \\nenhanced grid reliability. By adopting  robust and accurate models, utilities can harness the full potential of \\nanomaly detection to drive proactive maintenance strategies and build resilient and efficient smart grid \\ninfrastructures for the future.  \\n2.5  Possible Integration and Deployment Challenges: \\nWhile anomaly detection in IoT sensor data using machine learning techniques holds significant \\npromise for predictive maintenance in smart grids, its successful integration and deployment into real -world \\noperational environments present several challenges. Addressing these challenges is crucial to ensure that the \\nanomaly detection system functions effectively and provides tangible benefits to utility companies.\"),\n",

Real-Time Processing: \\nSmart grids generate a continuous strea m of sensor data in real -time. Anomaly detection models \\nmust process this data promptly to identify anomalies as they occur. Ensuring low -latency processing and \\nreal-time inference becomes critical to detect and respond to anomalies swiftly. Integrating an omaly \\ndetection systems with the existing grid infrastructure must consider the computational resources required for \\nreal-time analysis [24]. \\n2.5.2  Scalability: \\nSmart grids cover vast geographic areas, and the number of deployed IoT devices can be massive. \\nEnsuring that the anomaly detection system scales efficiently to handle the high volume of data from \\nnumerous devices is a significant challenge. Scalability considerations should encompass data storage, \\ncomputational power, and communication bandwidth to accommodate the increasing data influx [11]. \\n2.5.3  Data Privacy and Security: \\nSmart grid data contains sensitive information related to energy consumption patterns, user behavior, \\nand equipment status. Ensuring data privacy and safeguarding again st cybersecurity threats is of utmost \\nimportance. The integration of anomaly detection systems should adhere to robust data encryption, access \\ncontrol, and authentication mechanisms to protect against potential breaches [18]. \\n2.5.4  Model Interpretability: \\nMachine learning models used for anomaly detection are often complex and difficult to interpret. In \\nthe context of critical infrastructure like smart grids, model interpretability is essential for gaining insights \\ninto why anomalies are detected and makin g informed decisions. Employing techniques such as LIME \\n(Local Interpretable Model -agnostic Explanations) or SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) can help \\nprovide explanations for individual anomaly instances [27]. \\n2.5.5  Data Imbalance: \\nAnomalies are, by nature, infrequent in the dataset compared to normal data. This class imbalance \\ncan bias the model towards normal data, leading to lower recall for anomaly detection. Addressing data \\nimbalance through techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or using a ppropriate evaluation metrics is \\ncrucial to ensure accurate anomaly detection [24,26]. \\n2.5.6  Model Adaptation and Drift: \\nThe smart grid environment is dynamic, and the underlying data distribution may change over time \\ndue to system upgrades, changing cons umer behavior, or new equipment installations. Anomaly detection \\nmodels must adapt to these changes and accommodate data drift to maintain their effectiveness over \\nextended periods. Continuous model monitoring and adaptation strategies are essential for ensuring sustained \\nperformance [19]. \\n2.5.7  Human-In-The-Loop: \\nAnomaly detection systems should incorporate human -in-the-loop capabilities to allow human \\noperators and domain experts to review and validate detected anomalies. This interactive feedback loop \\nenables fine-tuning of the models, improving accuracy, and building trust in the system's results. \\n2.5.8  Cost and Resource Management: \\nImplementing and maintaining anomaly detection systems require financial investments and \\nresource allocation.

Furthermore, these variables are controlled in different values\\ndepending on the optimal conditions required by specific crops [6,7].\\nThe EC is a crucial parameter in hydroponics, as it directly influences nutrient avail-\\nability, water uptake, and overall plant growth, making precise management essential for\\noptimal yield and quality. For instance, Wongsorn et al. examined the impact of different\\nEC levels (1, 2, 3, and 4 mS/cm) on the vegetative growth of Pepino (Solanum muricatum).\\nTheir results show that EC levels significantly influenced plant growth parameters. EC\\nlevels of 2 and 3 mS/cm led to the highest chlorophyll fluorescence and leaf green index,\\nwhile an EC of 4 mS/cm resulted in the greatest plant height, canopy width, and stem\\ndiameter. Lower EC levels (1 and 2 mS/cm) were associated with increased flowering\\npercentages [8]. In addition, research on lettuce grown in vertical hydroponic systems has\\nrevealed that an EC level of 2.5 mS/cm produced the maximum yield, while an EC of\\n1.5 mS/cm resulted in the highest vitamin C and chlorophyll content [9]. This indicates that\\ndifferent EC levels can optimize either yield or quality depending on the desired outcome.\\nOn the other hand, the pH is also a critical factor in hydroponics. It directly affects\\nnutrient solubility and availability, root health, and overall plant growth. Thus, making\\nprecise pH management essential for optimal crop performance. For example, Hopkin-\\nson et al. found that extreme pH levels (both very acidic and very basic) hindered the\\ngrowth of bush beans (Phaseolus vulgaris). Plants grown in nutrient solutions with a pH of\\n5–6 exhibited healthier growth, while those at pH 8–9 showed stunted growth, thus reduc-\\ning internode length and signs of nutrient deficiencies. The optimal pH range for bush\\nbeans was identified as 5.6–6.2 to ensure adequate nutrient solubility and uptake [ 10].\\nMoreover, research on spinach grown hydroponically highlighted that maintaining a pH\\nrange of 5.5–6.5 led to faster growth and better nutrient absorption. When pH deviated\\nfrom this range, plants exhibited pale yellow leaves and reduced growth due to insufficient\\nnutrient uptake [11]. Therefore, the growth of plants in hydroponics depends equally on\\nboth pH and EC, as both parameters must be carefully regulated within their optimal\\nranges as shown in Figure 1. Unfortunately, farmers often face challenges in maintaining\\nconstant control over these variables [ 12]. Thus, the implementation of an automated\\ndosing system is becoming increasingly essential.\\nAgriEngineering\\xa02025,\\xa07,\\xa0x\\xa0FOR\\xa0PEER\\xa0REVIEW\\xa0 2\\xa0of\\xa025\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nResearch\\xa0regarding\\xa0hydroponic\\xa0nutrient\\xa0dosing\\xa0systems\\xa0usually\\xa0consists\\xa0of\\xa0the\\xa0adjust-\\nment\\xa0process\\xa0of\\xa0critical\\xa0variables\\xa0such\\xa0as\\xa0the\\xa0potential\\xa0of\\xa0hydrogen\\xa0(pH)\\xa0and\\xa0electrical\\xa0\\nconductivity\\xa0(EC).\\xa0Furthermore,\\xa0these\\xa0variables\\xa0are\\xa0controlled\\xa0in\\xa0diﬀerent\\xa0values\\xa0depend-\\ning\\xa0on\\xa0the\\xa0optimal\\xa0conditions\\xa0required\\xa0by\\xa0speciﬁc\\xa0crops\\xa0[6,7].\\xa0\\nThe\\xa0EC\\xa0is\\xa0a\\xa0crucial\\xa0parameter\\xa0in\\xa0hydroponics,\\xa0as\\xa0it\\xa0directly\\xa0inﬂuences\\xa0nutrient\\xa0avail-\\nability,\\xa0water\\xa0uptake,\\xa0and\\xa0overall\\xa0plant\\xa0growth,\\xa0making\\xa0precise\\xa0management\\xa0essential\\xa0for\\xa0\\noptimal\\xa0yield\\xa0and\\xa0quality.\\xa0For\\xa0instance,\\xa0Wongsorn\\xa0et\\xa0al.\\xa0examined\\xa0the\\xa0impact\\xa0of\\xa0diﬀerent\\xa0\\nEC\\xa0levels\\xa0(1,\\xa02,\\xa03,\\xa0and\\xa04\\xa0mS/cm)\\xa0on\\xa0the\\xa0vegetative\\xa0growth\\xa0of\\xa0Pepino\\xa0(Solanum\\xa0muricatum).\\xa0\\nTheir\\xa0results\\xa0show\\xa0that\\xa0EC\\xa0levels\\xa0signiﬁcantly\\xa0inﬂuenced\\xa0plant\\xa0growth\\xa0parameters.\\xa0EC\\xa0\\nlevels\\xa0of\\xa02\\xa0and\\xa03\\xa0mS/cm\\xa0led\\xa0to\\xa0the\\xa0highest\\xa0chlorophyll\\xa0ﬂuorescence\\xa0and\\xa0leaf\\xa0green\\xa0index,\\xa0\\nwhile\\xa0an\\xa0EC\\xa0of\\xa04\\xa0mS/cm\\xa0resulted\\xa0in\\xa0the\\xa0greatest\\xa0plant\\xa0height,\\xa0canopy\\xa0width,\\xa0and\\xa0stem\\xa0\\ndiameter.\\xa0Lower\\xa0EC\\xa0levels\\xa0(1\\xa0and\\xa02\\xa0mS/cm)\\xa0were\\xa0associated\\xa0with\\xa0increased\\xa0ﬂowering\\xa0per-\\ncentages\\xa0[8].\\xa0In\\xa0addition,\\xa0research\\xa0on\\xa0lettuce\\xa0grown\\xa0in\\xa0vertical\\xa0hydroponic\\xa0systems\\xa0has\\xa0\\nrevealed\\xa0that\\xa0an\\xa0EC\\xa0level\\xa0of\\xa02.5\\xa0mS/cm\\xa0produced\\xa0the\\xa0maximum\\xa0yield,\\xa0while\\xa0an\\xa0EC\\xa0of\\xa01.5\\xa0\\nmS/cm\\xa0resulted\\xa0in\\xa0the\\xa0highest\\xa0vitamin\\xa0C\\xa0and\\xa0chlorophyll\\xa0content\\xa0[9].\\xa0This\\xa0indicates\\xa0that\\xa0\\ndiﬀerent\\xa0EC\\xa0levels\\xa0can\\xa0optimize\\xa0either\\xa0yield\\xa0or\\xa0quality\\xa0depending\\xa0on\\xa0the\\xa0desired\\xa0outcome.\\xa0\\nOn\\xa0the\\xa0other\\xa0hand,\\xa0the\\xa0pH\\xa0is\\xa0also\\xa0a\\xa0critical\\xa0factor\\xa0in\\xa0hydroponics.\\xa0It\\xa0directly\\xa0aﬀects\\xa0\\nnutrient\\xa0solubility\\xa0and\\xa0availability,\\xa0root\\xa0health,\\xa0and\\xa0overall\\xa0plant\\xa0growth.\\xa0Thus,\\xa0making\\xa0\\nprecise\\xa0pH\\xa0management\\xa0essential\\xa0for\\xa0optimal\\xa0crop\\xa0performance.\\xa0For\\xa0example,\\xa0Hopkinson\\xa0\\net\\xa0al.\\xa0found\\xa0that\\xa0extreme\\xa0pH\\xa0levels\\xa0(both\\xa0very\\xa0acidic\\xa0and\\xa0very\\xa0basic)\\xa0hindered\\xa0the\\xa0growth\\xa0\\nof\\xa0bush\\xa0beans\\xa0(Phaseolus\\xa0vulgaris).\\xa0Plants\\xa0grown\\xa0in\\xa0nutrient\\xa0solutions\\xa0with\\xa0a\\xa0pH\\xa0of\\xa05–6\\xa0\\nexhibited\\xa0healthier\\xa0growth,\\xa0while\\xa0those\\xa0at\\xa0pH\\xa08–9\\xa0showed\\xa0stunted\\xa0growth,\\xa0thus\\xa0reducing\\xa0\\ninternode\\xa0length\\xa0and\\xa0signs\\xa0of\\xa0nutrient\\xa0deﬁciencies.\\xa0The\\xa0optimal\\xa0pH\\xa0range\\xa0for\\xa0bush\\xa0beans\\xa0\\nwas\\xa0identiﬁed\\xa0as\\xa05.6–6.2\\xa0to\\xa0ensure\\xa0adequate\\xa0nutrient\\xa0solubility\\xa0and\\xa0uptake\\xa0[10].\\xa0Moreover,\\xa0\\nresearch\\xa0on\\xa0spinach\\xa0grown\\xa0hydroponically\\xa0highlighted\\xa0that\\xa0maintaining\\xa0a\\xa0pH\\xa0range\\xa0of\\xa0\\n5.5–6.5\\xa0led\\xa0to\\xa0faster\\xa0growth\\xa0and\\xa0better\\xa0nutrient\\xa0absorption.\\xa0When\\xa0pH\\xa0deviated\\xa0from\\xa0this\\xa0\\nrange,\\xa0plants\\xa0exhibited\\xa0pale\\xa0yellow\\xa0leaves\\xa0and\\xa0reduced\\xa0growth\\xa0due\\xa0to\\xa0insuﬃcient\\xa0nutrient\\xa0\\nuptake\\xa0[11].\\xa0Therefore,\\xa0the\\xa0growth\\xa0of\\xa0plants\\xa0in\\xa0hydroponics\\xa0depends\\xa0equally\\xa0on\\xa0both\\xa0pH\\xa0\\nand\\xa0EC,\\xa0as\\xa0both\\xa0parameters\\xa0must\\xa0be\\xa0carefully\\xa0regulated\\xa0within\\xa0their\\xa0optimal\\xa0ranges\\xa0as\\xa0\\nshown\\xa0in\\xa0Figure\\xa01.\\xa0Unfortunately,\\xa0farmers\\xa0often\\xa0face\\xa0challenges\\xa0in\\xa0maintaining\\xa0constant\\xa0\\ncontrol\\xa0over\\xa0these\\xa0variables\\xa0[12].\\xa0Thus,\\xa0the\\xa0implementation\\xa0of\\xa0an\\xa0automated\\xa0dosing\\xa0sys-\\ntem\\xa0is\\xa0becoming\\xa0increasingly\\xa0essential.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nFigure 1.

Therefore, the research questions are as\\nfollows:\\n• What are the current research trends regarding hydroponic techniques and their\\nnutrient dosing operations?\\n• Which frameworks are predominantly used in conducting hydroponic nutrient\\ndosing operations?\\n• What variables are commonly considered in the hydroponic nutrient dosing framework?\\n• What methodological limitations and technological advancements exist in current\\nhydroponic dosing frameworks?\\n2.2. Information Source and Search Strategy\\nWhile the quality of research is not the primary concern in a systematic scoping review,\\nits scope must be comprehensive [18]. Thus, this study includes both peer-reviewed and\\nnon-peer-reviewed documents. The literature search encompassed five diverse databases:\\nWeb of Science (WoS), Scopus, ProQuest, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar. The selection of\\nkeywords for the literature search is crucial and should derive from the research questions.\\nAdditionally, the search terms can be expanded by incorporating synonyms, abbreviations,\\nalternative spellings, and related terms [18,20].

The\\nfeedback loop framework focuses on ongoing monitoring and comparison of current\\nvariable values with predetermined thresholds. This domain encompasses two methods:\\nthe conventional feedback loop ( n = 42) and the proportional integral derivative (PID)\\n(n = 3). On the contrary, the domain of predictive analytics utilizes analytical techniques to\\nanticipate variable responses based on previously trained data sets.

The automation process within this framework relies on activating\\ndosing actuators, which are controlled by predetermined threshold values for the relevant\\nvariables. This operational framework is exemplified in a flow chart provided by Hakam\\net al. [71]. This system continually compares the variables’ values against the set thresholds.\\nDosing actuators, such as servos [ 45], solenoid valves [ 33], and peristaltic pumps [ 50],\\nare triggered when variable values fall outside the acceptable range. Conversely, these\\nactuators are deactivated once the values realign with the specified thresholds.\\nThe PID control method is less utilized as a dosing framework. The PID control system\\nfunctions as a feedback mechanism, continuously calculating the error value by assessing\\nthe difference between the current measurement and the desired setpoint. For instance,\\nRyan et al. [25] determined the error value based on the variance from the pH setpoint\\nrange of 5.5 to 6.5. This error computation can then be leveraged to regulate the activation\\nof the dosing pump, utilizing pulse width modulation.\\nThe implementation of fuzzy logic in nutrient dosing frameworks typically involves a\\nsequence of steps: (1) fuzzification, (2) fuzzy inference, and (3) defuzzification [34]. During\\nfuzzification, input and output variables are defined as crisp values and are assigned to a\\nmembership function [37]. These variables are then modeled linguistically or mathemat-\\nically according to the applied fuzzy inference system [ 43]. This system operates based\\non “if-then” rules and the “and” fuzzy logic operator. Defuzzification involves transform-\\ning aggregated fuzzy output into a singular, precise value. Fakhrurroja et al. [ 42] have\\nexemplified this by converting the fuzzy output regarding pump activation time.\\nMachine learning is also increasingly employed in nutrient dosing frameworks. Its\\napplication involves processing extensive datasets, typically divided into two categories:\\na training dataset and a testing dataset [ 49,83]. The training dataset is used to develop\\na model that guides the decision-making process for activating the dosing actuator. For\\nexample, Albert et al. [99] implemented the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) machine learning\\ntechnique to determine the appropriate activation timing for a dosing pump. In a different\\nstudy, Arora et al. [14] used an artificial neural network (ANN) to regulate the pH of a\\nnutrient solution based on the color of the plant, which was determined by the red–green–\\nblue (RGB) values of image pixels. In this context, machine learning falls under predictive\\nanalytics, which entails using predictive models or decision-making processes to estimate\\nthe nutrient solution’s final pH and EC measurements.\\nThe reviewed studies indicate using statistical techniques as predictive analytics in\\nthe nutrient dosing framework. This approach primarily involves regression analysis to\\npropose predictive models, relating dependent variables (responses) with independent\\nvariables (predictors). The selection of the regression method depends on the number of\\npredictors and responses involved. For instance, Abd Rahman et al. [32] employed linear\\nregression to control the EC of the nutrient solution by predicting the activation time of\\nthe dosing pump. Another prevalent method is multiple linear regression, which predicts\\na response based on several predictors. Helmy et al. [ 56] conducted research aiming to\\nregulate the pH level of the nutrient solution, considering two predictors: the nutrient\\nsolution level and the time required to activate the dosing pump.\\nIn conclusion, the nutrient dosing frameworks in hydroponics can be categorized\\ninto two primary approaches: feedback loop and predictive analytics. The feedback loop\\nframework, depicted in Figure 5a, emphasizes real-time threshold monitoring and im-\\nmediate corrective actions to maintain optimal solution parameters. In contrast, the\\npredictive analytics framework, shown in Figure 5b, leverages data-driven methods\\nto anticipate input variable adjustments, enabling precise and efficient dosing deci-\\nsions. Together, these frameworks illustrate the balance between reactive control and'),\n",

Dosing variables. (a) The frequency of individual variables included (b) the frequency of\\nintegration of variables in a dosing system.\\nThe concentration of hydroponic nutrient solution is represented by either EC or\\nTDS. EC measures the ability of a nutrient solution to conduct electrical current [110]. On\\nthe other hand, TDS quantifies the concentration of dissolved solid particles [ 111]. Low\\nEC and TDS measurements mean insufficient nutrients, while high values can cause salt-\\ninduced plant stress [112]. Research indicates a strong correlation between EC and TDS.\\nThe correlation between EC and TDS has been studied over the years, with Sulastri and\\nAkhdiana [113] stating that these variables are closely related to each other. They can be\\ncorrelated using the following equation: TDS = k x EC, where k is a constant value either\\n0.55 or 0.75 [109]. To ensure optimal plant growth in hydroponic cultivation, the EC and\\nTDS measurements must be constantly regulated.\\nNST in hydroponics is another critical factor affecting plant growth and nutrient\\nabsorption. Optimal NST is crucial for enhancing crop growth and minimizing potential\\nharm [114]. Higher NST levels have been found to enhance the solubility of minerals,\\nthereby improving plant nutrient uptake as solute dissolution rates increase with tempera-\\nture [13]. Additionally, NST significantly influences oxygen availability in the root zone\\nof the plants. Research has shown that root zone temperature is integral in modulating\\noxygen availability and consumption, which in turn affects plant growth and physiological\\nfunctions [115,116].\\nNSV in hydroponic systems significantly influences the pH and EC of the solution.\\nResearch indicates that NSV fluctuations can cause ion concentration and overall nutrient\\ncontent changes, affecting EC and pH levels. Specifically, NSV adjustment directly impacts\\nthe EC of the nutrient solution: an increase in NSV dilutes ion concentration, reducing EC,\\nwhile a decrease in NSV raises ion concentration, increasing EC [117,118].

Adjusting NSV affects the balance of acidic and\\nbasic components in the nutrient solution, leading to pH fluctuations. An increased NSV\\ntypically raises the pH by diluting the solution, whereas a decreased NSV concentrates\\non the solution and lowers the pH [ 119,120]. Consequently, NSV is a critical factor in\\ndetermining the acidity or alkalinity of the nutrient solution. Understanding and controlling\\nNSV is crucial for maintaining optimal nutrient levels and pH balance, ensuring healthy\\nplant growth and development in hydroponic environments.\\nFigure 6b shows the inclusion of dosing variables in a single system. The selection\\nof variables is vital in assessing the effectiveness and reliability of a dosing framework.\\nContinuous monitoring and control of pH, EC, TDS, NST, and NSV are critical for effective\\nand efficient nutrient dosing systems. Notably, when both a pH and an EC or TDS probe are\\nimmersed in the same solution, using an analog isolator module is imperative to prevent\\nelectrical interference. Such interference can lead to inaccurate readings of both EC and pH\\nlevels [75]. It is essential to include both pH and either EC or TDS in a dosing operation\\nas these variables could be used as guidelines to avoid certain unwanted occurrences\\nsuch as nutrient precipitations [ 121]. However, the inclusion of NSV in the variable\\nset is not mandatory. Omitting NSV from the dosing framework implies the absence\\nof a normalization procedure, meaning that the NSV is not adjusted to a normalized\\nvolume. Consequently, such a dosing framework would not be suitable for use during\\nthe replenishment of hydroponic nutrient solutions, where complete replacement of the\\nsolution is necessary.\\n3.4. Significance of Dosing Variables Across Various Frameworks\\nThe analysis of dosing variables across hydroponic nutrient dosing frameworks is cru-\\ncial for optimizing systems, evaluating frameworks, and guiding future research. It aids in\\nresource allocation, standardization efforts, and technology development. Understanding\\nvariable significance enhances cross-disciplinary integration and informs best practices\\nin precision agriculture and sustainable food production. Table 2 presents the frequency\\ndistribution of parameter inclusion across these frameworks. A chi-square test of indepen-\\ndence was conducted by using Minitab statistical software (version 22), to determine the\\nsignificance of the relationship between dosing frameworks and parameter inclusion.\\nTable 2.

The lack of statistical significance aligns with recent\\ntrends in hydroponic research, where parameter selection is often based on specific experi-\\nmental needs rather than being constrained by the chosen dosing framework.

Dosing Strategy\\nUpon careful examination, it is observed that the output variables of the nutrient\\ndosing system consist of either pH or EC or both variables. Conversely, the input variables\\nmay include an EC adjustment solution, a pH adjustment solution, or both. Therefore,\\nwe classify the dosing strategy into single input single output (SISO) and multiple input\\nmultiple output (MIMO). An SISO strategy is generally more straightforward, as it requires\\nto regulate only one variable. However, an MIMO strategy is more complex as they\\nneed to control both pH and EC values. MIMO can be performed either sequentially\\nor simultaneously. Studies like those by Adidrana et al. [ 84] and Herman et al. [ 48]\\ndemonstrate simultaneous dosing of pH and TDS, where dosing actuators are activated\\nsimultaneously. This approach allows for the simultaneous control of several variables,\\nshowing a more intricate yet effective way to control nutritional solutions.

However,\\nin frameworks utilizing fuzzy logic and predictive analytics, the activation of actuators\\nis achieved through different strategies, often based on pre-determined strategies such\\nas time-based [24,32,43], rotation-based [24,45], volume-based [14,34,74], and others.

Regarding dosing speed,\\nIbrahim et al. [24] stated that a well-defined dosage model would likely decrease dosing\\ntime. Additionally, Dae Hyun et al. [22] found that the sequential dosing strategy produces\\ninaccurate results. He also found that excluding the EC of tap water (EC w) led to high\\nrelative errors. Similarly, erroneous pH readings could be caused in part by the pH of the\\nwater coming out of the faucet (pHw). In addition, studies conducted by Arora et al. [14]\\nhave shown that the EC of the pH down solution (ECd) changes the final EC value of the\\nnutrient solution (ECf), which may affect its pH (pHf). Therefore, variations in the EC and\\npH of the dosing solutions could lead to differing impacts on the nutrient solution. Notably,\\nnone of the studies we reviewed accounted for the combined effect of dosing variables of\\nall dosing solutions and confounding variables, thus limiting the robustness of their dosing\\nmodels to variations in dosing solutions. Therefore, the suggested framework proposes a\\npredictive dosing model using multivariate linear regression. Besides that, the temperature\\nof each dosing solution also needs to be measured, and the EC and pH values must be\\ncompensated for at 25 ◦C.

Therefore, developing the predictive models begins with the screening process,\\nusing a definitive screening design (DSD) that uses numerous variables while requiring\\nfewer runs [125]. This serves as a statistical tool with which to identify the key variables\\nthat significantly affect responses, in our case, the final value of pH, EC, and volume of the\\nhydroponic nutrient solution. Therefore, only significant variables should be included in\\nthe predictive models to optimize the dosing framework. The variables are divided into\\ntwo classifications: (1) controlled variables and (2) confounding variables, as shown in\\nTable 3.\\nTable 3. Classifications of dosing variables. The controlled variables are the variables that can be\\nset during the experiments; meanwhile, the confounding variables are the variables that cannot be\\ncontrolled but are known to affect the responses.\\nDosing Solution Controlled Variables Confounding Variables Responses\\nConcentrated nutrient solution A EC a Vola pHa pHf\\nConcentrated nutrient solution B EC b Volb pHb\\npH up pH u Volu ECu ECf\\npH down pH d Vold ECd\\nTap water Vol w ECw pHw Volf\\nRemaining nutrient solution Vol r ECr pHr\\nNext, the response surface methodology (RSM) can be conducted to construct detailed\\nmodeling by analyzing complex relationships. Three predictive models will be proposed\\nbased on the identified responses. The proposed hydroponic dosing framework can be\\nfurther optimized by utilizing RSM and desirability function [ 126,127]. This method\\nallows us to optimize multiple responses simultaneously by converting each response\\ninto a desirability value ranging from 0 (undesired) to 1 (fully desired), in some research,\\nconverted to percentage [ 128]. Each of these desirability values will then be combined\\nto obtain a composite desirability score, which can be optimized to identify the optimal\\ninput variables for hydroponic dosing operations. Lastly, validating the predictive models\\nand results is critical in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the proposed framework.\\nResearchers can use statistical analysis for model validation and perform experiments in\\nreal-world conditions to ensure that the framework accurately reflects the behavior of the\\nproposed dosing framework.

Conclusions\\nEffective controls of hydroponic nutrient solutions are crucial for the success of hydro-\\nponics cultivation. This systematic scoping review has outlined various frameworks for\\nhydroponic nutrient dosing operations by comprehensively reviewing 81 research articles\\non the hydroponic nutrient dosing framework. These frameworks are categorized into\\ntwo domains: feedback loop and predictive analytics. Each domain influences whether\\ndosing operations are conducted sequentially or simultaneously, affecting the required\\ndosing time. The study emphasizes the importance of critical dosing variables, including\\npH, EC or TDS, NST, and NSV . In detail, pH, EC, and TDS are vital variables that need to be\\nmaintained within specific thresholds, while NSV is crucial when normalization procedures\\nare implemented. On the other hand, the measurement of NST is essential to include the\\ntemperature compensation factor while measuring pH, EC, and TDS.\\nThis comprehensive review also highlights the crucial significance and complex rela-\\ntionship between these dosing variables. However, these variables must be included in a\\nsingle dosing system to enhance performance. The insights gained from this review lay a\\nrobust foundation for a thorough understanding of the various aspects of nutrient dosing\\nstrategies, significantly enhancing agricultural practices in precision and efficiency.\\nHowever, this scoping review is limited to research articles, and including review\\narticles in future studies may provide additional insights into hydroponic nutrient dosing\\nsystems. We discovered that the existing nutrient dosing frameworks need to be revised\\nin order to be robust. Future research is encouraged to utilize and optimize our proposed\\ndosing framework, which may offer significant improvements. Our proposed framework\\nis expected to significantly contribute to nutrient dosing operations’ robustness, accuracy,\\nand efficiency, representing a meaningful advancement in precision hydroponics. This\\ncomprehensive approach aims to address current challenges and pave the way for more\\nefficient and effective hydroponic farming practices.\\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, H.S., A.A.Y. and M.K.M.N.; methodology, H.S.; software,\\nH.S.; validation, H.S., A.A.Y. and M.K.M.N.; formal analysis, H.S.; investigation, H.S.; resources,\\nH.S.; data curation, H.S.; writing—original draft preparation, H.S.; writing—review and editing, H.S.,\\nA.A.Y. and M.K.M.N.; visualization, H.S.; supervision, A.A.Y. and M.K.M.N.; project administration,\\nH.S.

This study provides a systematic scoping review of automated hydroponic nutrient dosing systems, focusing on potential of hydrogen (pH) and electrical conductivity (EC) dosing frameworks. Following preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses extension for systematic scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines, 3222 studies were retrieved and screened, with 89 meeting inclusion criteria for analysis. The review aimed to identify current research trends, dosing frameworks, critical variables, and research gaps. Results reveal a steady rise in publications from 2015 (n = 4) to 2022 (n = 18). Feedback loop frameworks and predictive analytics are equally represented (n = 45 each). Critical variables include pH (n = 70), EC (n = 36), total dissolved solids (TDS) (n = 27), nutrient solution volume (NSV) (n = 42), and nutrient solution temperature (NST) (n = 28). The study highlights the need for robust frameworks incorporating advanced dosing frameworks and simultaneous dosing strategies to enhance dosing speed, accuracy, and robustness. A novel framework is proposed to address these gaps by integrating predictive analytics using multiple regression models. This framework aims to improve the dosing speed, accuracy, and robustness of automated hydroponic nutrient dosing systems.

Smart Agriculture Architecture 1 \\nSmart agriculture has emerged as a major player in modern farming practices. It takes 2 \\nadvantage of advanced technologies such as the IoT, cloud computing, and machine 3 \\nlearning to improve crop production, improve resource management, and reduce 4 \\nenvironmental impact. However, the increasing reliance on digital technologies exposes 5 \\nsmart agriculture systems to various cybersecurity threats [1,5].  In the Smart agriculture 6 \\narchitecture, the layers typically include sensor devices, connectivity, data processing and 7 \\nanalytics, and application layers. Sensor devices collect data on various parameters such 8 \\nas soil moisture, temperature, and crop health. The connectivity layer enables 9 \\ncommunication between the sensors and the data processing and analytics layer, which 10 \\ninvolves cloud -based or edge -based systems for data storage, analysis, and decision - 11 \\nmaking. The application layer encompasses the user interfaces and applications that 12 \\nprovide fa rmers with insights, recommendations, and control over the agricultural 13 \\nprocesses [1,2, 17]. Figure 3 shows the layers of Smart agriculture architecture. 14 \\n▪ The Sensor Layer:  This layer is the foundation of the smart farming architecture, 15 \\nconsisting of various sensors deployed throughout the farm. These sensors monitor 16 \\nand collect data on environmental conditions, soil moisture levels, temperature, 17 \\nhumidity, and other relevant parameters. They provide real -time information to the 18 \\nhigher layers of the architecture for analysis and decision-making. 19 \\n▪ The Edge Layer: This layer acts as a vital intermediary between the Sensor Layer and 20 \\nthe Cloud Layer, performing data processing and analysis locally. Securing this layer 21 \\nis essential for data protection, system perfor mance, and defense against 22 \\ncyberattacks. It ensures data integrity, and real-time threat detection, and follows a 23 \\nlayered security approach. This investment safeguards sensitive data, optimizes 24 \\noperations, and ensures the long-term success of smart farming. 25 \\n▪ The Cloud Layer:  This layer  represents the centralized computing infrastructure 26 \\nwhere data from the sensors is stored, processed, and analyzed. It typically involves 27 \\ncloud-based platforms and services that provide advanced analytics, machine 28 \\nlearning algorithms, and data storage capabilities. The Cloud Layer enables farmers 29 \\nto gain insights, make informed decisions, and optimize farming operations based 30 \\non the collected data. 31 \\n2.2. Importance of Edge Networks Security 32 \\nCloud computing in Smart agriculture refers to the utilization of remote servers and 33 \\ndata centers for storing and processing agricultural data. It offers vast storage capacity and 34 \\ncomputational power, enabling complex data analysis and resource -intensive 35 \\napplications[3,14]. However, relying solely on the cloud for all computational tasks may 36 \\nintroduce potential risks, including the potential for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) 37 \\nattacks that can disrupt cloud services.  On the other hand, edge networks in Smart 38 \\nagriculture involve deploying computational resources closer to the data source, such as 39 \\non farm gateways or edge devices. Edge computing brings processing capabilities closer 40 \\nto the agricultural field, reducing la tency and dependence on remote cloud servers. It 41 \\nenables real-time data analysis, decision -making, and immediate responses to changing 42'),\n",

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 8 \\nThe LSTM algorithm is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) widely used for 9 \\nanalyzing time series data and prediction tasks. It is effective in capturing long -term 10 \\ndependencies and contextual information in sequential data  [10]. The LSTM algorithm 11 \\nconsists of LSTM units, which are memory cells capable of storing and accessing 12 \\ninformation over extended time periods. These cells allow important information from 13 \\nprevious parts of the sequence to be preserved and used for making predictions in 14 \\nsubsequent time steps  [4]. LSTM units have three main components: the input gate, the 15 \\nforget gate, and the output gate. These gates control the flow of information into, out  of, 16 \\nand within the memory cells. The input gate determines which parts of the input are 17 \\nimportant for memory, the forget gate decides which information should be discarded 18 \\nfrom the memory cells, and the output gate regulates the flow of information from t he 19 \\nmemory cells to the LSTM unit's output [23].

This integrated approach enhances the model's ability to 11 \\nidentify complex patterns, making it an effective tool for network security [23]. 12 \\n 13 \\nOne reason for the decrease in detection rates when using the algorithms separately is the 14 \\nlimited scope of each algorithm. The CNN algorithm primarily focuses on spatial features, 15 \\nwhile the LSTM a lgorithm primarily deals with temporal patterns. When applied 16 \\nindividually, each algorithm may overlook important information from the other domain. 17 \\nBy solely using the CNN algorithm, for example, the model may struggle to capture long- 18 \\nterm temporal patterns that are crucial for detecting certain types of attacks or anomalies. 19 \\nSimilarly, relying solely on the LSTM algorithm may result in overlooking spatial features 20 \\nand patterns that are indicative of attacks or anomalies.  Therefore, when using the 21 \\nalgorithms separately, the model lacks a comprehensive analysis of both spatial and 22 \\ntemporal dimensions, leading to a lower detection rate.

Overview of the proposed model  7 \\nIn this section, we propose a deep learning -based approach for detecting anomalies 8 \\nin smart agriculture systems on the network edge. The data flow process in securing smart 9 \\nfarms from DDoS attacks begins at the sensor device within the farm. The sensor device 10 \\ncollects various data points, such as environmental conditions, crop health metrics, and 11 \\nlivestock monitoring information. These data points are then transmitted to the network 12 \\nedge, which serves as the first line of defense against  potential DDoS attacks. At the net- 13 \\nwork edge, the collected data is subjected to deep learning algorithms CNN -LSTM. The 14 \\nCNN component is responsible for extracting spatial and temporal features from the data, 15 \\nwhile the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) component handles the sequential analysis, 16 \\ncapturing dependencies over time. 17 \\n 18 \\nThe data is passed through the CNN-LSTM model, which has been trained on a large 19 \\ndataset of both normal and anomalous farm data. During the classification process, the 20 \\nmodel compares the input data to the learned patterns and determines whether it is nor- 21 \\nmal or anomalous. If the data is classified as normal, it is allowed to continue its flow 22 \\nthrough the network. However, if the data is classified as anomalous, an alert is promptly 23 \\ngenerated to notify the farm operator or relevant personnel about the potential security 24 \\nbreach. Simultaneously, as the alert is sent, the anomalous data is blocked from further 25 \\nprogression within the network. This proactive measure prevents potentially malicious or 26 \\nharmful data from infiltrating the smart farm system and causing disruptions or damages. 27 \\nBy employing deep learning algorithms, specifically CNN -LSTM, at the network edge, 28 \\nthe smart farm system can effectively analyze and classify incoming data in real time. This 29 \\nproactive approach ensures the security and integrity of the farm's operations by swiftly 30 \\nidentifying and mitigating potential DDoS attacks. Furthermore, the system's ability to 31 \\ngenerate alerts enables prompt responses from farm operators or s ecurity personnel, al- 32 \\nlowing them to take appropriate actions to safeguard the smart farm environment.  The 33 \\ndata flow process in securing smart farms from DDoS attacks involves the collection of 34 \\ndata from the sensor device, passing it through the network edg e, and applying deep 35 \\nlearning techniques, such as CNN -LSTM, for real -time classification. This approach en- 36 \\nsures that normal data is allowed to proceed while anomalous data triggers an alert and 37 \\nsubsequent blocking. By implementing such a robust security sy stem, smart farms can 38 \\noperate with enhanced protection against DDoS attacks, maintaining the integrity and 39 \\nuninterrupted functionality of their agricultural operations. In conclusion, using this pro- 40 \\nposed approach at the edge of the network offers several a dvantages. Firstly, it enables 41 \\nreal-time analysis and classification of incoming data, allowing for immediate action in 42 \\ncase of anomalies.

As a result, we had to change the 1 \\ntesting environment and conducted the test on an Amazon Web service mi.m5.16xlarge 2 \\nwith 64 VCPUs and equipped with 256 gigabytes of RAM. Initially, the dataset was split 3 \\ninto training and testing sets, with 80% devoted to training and 20% to tes ting. The 4 \\nCICDDoS2019 dataset contains 83 features as shown in Figure 10, the top 69 features in 5 \\nthe correlation matrix were taken with respect to the label , and the rest of the features 6 \\nwere dropped to speed up the computation and reduce noise that might affect model per- 7 \\nformance.

The data is then normalized using a minimum normalization algo- 10 \\nrithm to eliminate the possibility that one trait is dominant and unweight the other fea- 11 \\ntures. In the CICDDoS2019 dataset After conducting a correlation matrix analysis, the de- 12 \\ncision was made to eliminate the four features that displayed the least amount of correla- 13 \\ntion. To decrease the dimensionality of the dataset and eliminate characteristics that ex- 14 \\nhibit minimal correlation with the target variable or other pertinent features, a correlation 15 \\nmatrix was computed. The dataset underwent feature selection based on correlation anal- 16 \\nysis, resulting in the identification and subsequent removal of the four features with the 17 \\nlowest correlation. This procedure facilitates the optimization of the dataset by eliminat- 18 \\ning features that may be redundant or lack informative value. 19 \\n 20 \\nIt is often necessary to encode textual columns, such as the \"Label\" column, into nu- 21 \\nmerical values to effectively utilize them in machine learning algorithms. During this 22 \\nstage, a suitable encoding methodology was impleme nted to transform the textual labels 23 \\ninto numerical representations. Typical techniques for encoding data involve label encod- 24 \\ning, one-hot encoding, or ordinal encoding, contingent upon the particular needs of the 25 \\nanalysis. Omitting null values is a crucial step in ensuring the precision and dependability 26 \\nof the analysis. The absence or nullity of values can have a substantial impact on the re- 27 \\nsults. Consequently, in this stage, any rows or columns that contained null values were 28 \\neliminated from the dataset. In cases where data is missing, imputation methods may be 29 \\nutilized to complete the dataset, taking into account the type and scope of the absent in- 30 \\nformation. In cases where the quantity of missing values is significant or if imputation is 31 \\ndeemed unsuitable, the exclusion of null values is a legitimate method to safeguard the 32 \\ndataset\\'s integrity. The CICDDoS2019 dataset underwent preprocessing procedures to fa- 33 \\ncilitate further analysis, which involved ensuring data consistency, reducing dimension- 34 \\nality, and ad dressing missing values.

Maximizing recall is crucial in scenarios 34 \\nwhere it is important to minimize false negatives and ensure comprehensive coverage of 35 \\nthe target population or desired outcomes. 36 \\nRecall = 𝑇𝑃\\n(𝑇𝑃 + 𝐹𝑁) \\n \\n(3)'),\n",

It pro- 1 \\nvides a balanced evaluation of a classification or information retrieval system's perfor- 2 \\nmance. The F1 score is calculated as th e harmonic mean of precision and recall, ranging 3 \\nfrom 0 to 1. It is particularly useful for assessing performance in imbalanced datasets and 4 \\nconsiders both false positives and false negatives. 5 \\nF − score = 2x (Precision x Recall)\\n(Precision +  Recall) (4) \\n The CNN-LSTM model accuracy and loss were measured for both the training 6 \\nand validation sets at each epoch value. It allows us to assess if the model has been suffi- 7 \\nciently learned to differentiate between various anomalies and how many data points in 8 \\nthe validation set have been correct ly identified. In addition, the accuracy and loss of the 9 \\nCNN and LSTM models were measured separately.

Despite 16 \\nboth datasets being divided using the same 80/20 split for training and testing, the 17 \\nCICDDoS2019 dataset's considerably larger size and longer training duration likely con- 18 \\ntributed to its superior performance. 19 \\nThe larger size of the CICDDoS2019 dataset provided a more extensive and diverse 20 \\nset of samples for the deep learning model to learn from, allowing it to capture a wider 21 \\nrange of patterns and anomalies. The increased number of samples improved the model's 22 \\nability to generalize and detect anomalies accurately, resulting in a higher accuracy rate. 23 \\nMoreover, the longer training duration for the CICDDoS2019 dataset allowed the 24 \\nmodel to explore and learn complex patterns more thoroughly. The additional training 25 \\ntime enabled the model to fine-tune its parameters and adjust its internal representations, 26 \\nleading to improved performance and a higher accuracy rate observed. 27 \\n 28 \\nThe upward trend of the learning curve indicates that the model learns quickly and 29 \\nefficiently. The rate of improvement can be observed in Figures 13 and 14 below, show- 30 \\ncasing the progressive nature of the model's learning process. The ROC curve, depicted 31 \\nin Figure 15, serves as a visual representation of the model's ability to effectively learn and 32 \\ndiscriminate between different classes or categories. The steep upward trend observed in 33 \\nthe ROC curve signifies the model's rapid acquisition of accurate prediction abilities, lead- 34 \\ning to high-performance results. Consequently, the ROC curve provides valuable insights 35\"),\n",

Conclusions and Future Works 2 \\nIn this research, deep learning techniques have shown their ability to correctly classify 3 \\nanomalies in many areas of research. However, hackers use new and innovative tech- 4 \\nniques to launch cyberattacks. While great attempts to track down these attacks have the 5 \\nadvantage that they continue to occur in multiple ways to cooperate with other potential 6 \\nattacks such as DDoS att acks and botnets. This paper proposes an anomaly detection 7 \\nmodel for IoT networks in smart agriculture using CNN-LSTM. It was performed on two 8 \\ndifferent datasets, namely IoT-23 and CICDDoS2019. The proposed model achieved high 9 \\naccuracy for current classifi cation strategies and modern deep learning applications. In 10 \\nterms of anomaly detection accuracy using the proposed model, the rate is 99.47%, and it 11 \\ncan be more efficient if applied at the edge of the network. In future work, we will inves- 12 \\ntigate further anomaly detection using various deep learning methods, such as DBN and 13 \\nGAN, and compare the results with those obtained with CNN-LSTM. 14 \\n 15 \\nFigure 16.

This \\nmethod takes a lot of time to decompose making it prone to \\ndiseases and also requires human effort. To fulfill the demands \\nof the increasing population especially in metropolitan cities, \\nfarmers and commercial plantation companies are forced to \\nuse harmful chemicals to increase production, which affects \\nthe consumers in the long run. Hydroponics is a technique \\nwhich can be used to grow plants without soil. In this \\ntechnique, the plant gets all the required nutrients from the \\nwater solution. An automated dosing system in Hydroponics \\ncan be monitored and controlled with the help of machine \\nlearning algorithms like Deep Neural Networks. We will \\ndiscuss how IoT enables communication between machines \\nand also study the parameters which affect plant growth in the \\nhydroponic system.  \\nKeywords— Hydroponics, Automation, Machine learning, \\nInternet of Things (IoT) \\n \\nI. INTRODUCTION \\nCultivation of plants in soil has been done for a very long time \\non earth. But now with these great technological advancements \\nby humans, we can monitor the growth of plants through \\nmachine learning and can grow them in water due to which the \\nnutrients required by a plant can be given directly from the \\nwater which can be administered depending on how much \\nnutrients can be given to have the desired yield. This type of \\ncultivation of plants is known as Hydroponics.  \\nHydroponics can be useful not just for monitoring and getting \\nthe desired yield but also for future space exploration too. In \\nHydroponics the plants can be without soil that makes it much \\neasier for us to monitor the number of nutrients that should be \\nsupplied for the perfect yield. As soil is not used in this \\ncultivation the risk of crop failure gradually decreases and \\nbeing able to implement machine learning in this system to \\ndetect changes in growth can also decrease the chance of plants \\ngetting disease or abnormality in the growth of the plant. \\nThe major disadvantage of hydroponics is that it can be \\nexpensive to implement it on a very large scale than the \\ntraditional farming methods. But the quality and yield can be \\ncontrolled in hydroponics which can\\'t be done by the traditional \\nfarming methods.                  \\nII.      LITERATURE REVIEW \\nA. Hydroponic Methods for Soilless Production Systems \\nSoilless development addresses a substantial chance for the \\nrural creation area, particularly in regions described by serious \\nsoil corruption and restricted water accessibility. Moreover, this \\nagronomic practice exemplifies an ideal reaction toward a \\nclimate amicable agriculture and a promising instrument in the \\nvision of an overall test regarding food security. Lenord Melvix \\nJ.S.M and Sridevi C in [2] described the procedures required in \\nan effective soilless production system. It is generally realized \\nthat the efficiency and nature of yields filled in hydroponic \\nsystems are notably subject to the degree of the plant nutrients \\nprocurement from the developing medium. Additionally, the \\nsevere reliance on farming practice on water accessibility \\nduring a time of radical environmental changes makes the \\nsituation much more perplexing.

Specifically, various substance \\nequilibria should be considered while getting ready  nutrients \\narrangements utilizing salts or focused fluid stocks, particularly \\nsolubilization/precipitation harmony. Truth be told , various \\nphysical-chemical parameters can change the nutrien ts \\naccessibility for plants, the most significant of which are:  \\n(1) Precipitation  \\n(2) Co-precipitation  \\n(3) Complexation  \\nIn this regard, it ought to be featured that the temperature of the \\nnutrient’s arrangement, influencing the synthetic balance in the \\narrangement, may extensively impact these cycles. T his is \\nespecially pivotal for territories where the over warming of the \\nnutrients arrangement frequently happens, affecting  \\nadditionally at the physiological degree of harvest s. Saltiness \\nincrement could be differentiated by treating the r eused water \\nwith proper osmotic systems, including forward and turn \\naround assimilation. \\n \\nB.    IoT in Automated dosing system \\nIoT (Internet of things) is a group of things that can collect data \\nand upload it to the cloud and also can be interacted through the \\nweb. Manav Mehra and Sameer Saxena in [12] proposed  an \\nideal methodology for implementing IoT. Making \\ntechnological advancements in IoT has permitted far mers to \\ncomputerize hydroponic systems. Right pH level, air  \\ntemperature, relative humidity, pH level, nutrients  level of the \\nwater, and right water system of water is fundament ally \\nsignificant in hydroponics. In this manner, the hyd roponic \\nsystem that screens these parameters is important a nd will \\nguarantee higher achievement and productivity paces  of the \\ncultivator. \\n \\nAlong these lines, with this in view, a serious mea sure of \\nexamination has been conveyed by utilizing IoT for observing \\nand controlling the automated dosing system. It emp owers \\nclients to control certain components for topping o ff, \\nsprinkling, depleting, and a lot more highlights wi th the \\nassistance of a web application.  \\n \\nThe utilization of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) empowers \\na broadly interconnected registering climate because of a blend \\nof detecting and remote correspondence advancements  \\ndispersed over a specific region. The capacity of a  wireless \\nsensor to accumulate and hand-off data between hubs  in a \\nconstant climate has opened the potential for WSNs to be \\nutilized for a wide cluster of utilizations. \\nC.  Smart Hydroponics system \\nT R Sreedevi and M.B Santosh Kumar in [6] defined h ow an \\nideal smart hydroponic system is categorized. There  are four \\ncategories of Smart Hydroponic Systems. \\n1.  Automation Level:  In this part, the order of \\nhydroponic systems depends on fair and square \\nrobotization. Hydroponic can be considered semi-\\nmechanized and completely computerized. First, we \\nhave to get every single part, and then we have to get \\nevery part to form a hydroponic system that has every \\none of its parts naturally controlled. \\n2.  Tasks Automated:  In this category, systems are based \\non how much the task is automated. So, smart \\nhydroponics can be established in such a way that i t \\ncan help the system by prolonging the system's \\nhardware, providing nutrients to the system, and \\ndemonstrating development identified with crop \\nupkeep, such as moving seedlings from nursery to \\nhydroponic system, supplanting dead plants, and \\nreaping. The last subcategory screens a few or all parts \\nof the system and reports it. \\n3.  Automation type:  A smart hydroponic system can be \\nconsidered as an embedded system so it comes under \\nthe category of automation. For tuning and changing  \\nthe settings of the system, users must be present f or \\nkeeping an eye on the behavior of the system. Wireless \\nSensor Networks are also another broad category \\nwhere a single base station is used for controlling  the \\nnetwork of the embedded system and users can access \\ndata. To improve the versatility within the web, th e \\nIoT based hydroponic system has to be fundamentally \\nassociated with WSNs \\n4.  Method of Control:  In a smart hydroponic system \\nwhere actuators are included, controlling how the \\nactuators carry on is a vital part of the system. I n this \\npaper, the method of control is divided into categories \\ni.e., Proportional Integral and Derivative controll er \\nalso known as PID controller.  These controllers ar e \\ncreated for utilizing control designing methods. \\nArtificial intelligence can be implemented for broa d \\ncategories like controlling how the actuators complete \\ntheir tasks without damaging the system. \\n       D.      Estimation of EC and pH \\nIn a hydroponic system, water is used for circulati ng the \\nnutrient solution to the plants. Stock A and Stock B solutions \\nare the commonly used nutrient solutions in hydropo nic \\nsystems. Saaid, M.F., and Fadhil in [7] proposed a methodology \\nfor calculation of EC (Electrical Conductivity) as well as pH in \\nthe hydroponic system. The fertilizer used in this hydroponic \\nsystem is from the Royal Project Foundation which i s a \\ncomposing solution. The solutions which are used in  this \\nresearch are favorable for small cultivation. The fertilizer which \\nis used must be blended between Stock A and Stock B  \\nsolutions. Afterward, blended fertilizer is filled in 120 liters of \\nwater. This blended fertilizer must be filled at re gular intervals \\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: ULAKBIM UASL - GAZI UNIV.

Stock A \\nand Stock B are consistently monitored and controll ed so that \\nplant growth is maintained. Stock A and Stock B with water are \\ntermed as nutrient solutions for the hydroponic system. \\n \\n    E.     Hydroponics a Sustainable Agriculture Sy stem  \\nHydroponics plant cultivation is considered more ef ficient as \\nwater consumption is reduced by 90% as a result of which more \\nfruits and vegetables are produced in limited time.  It also has a \\nvery minimal carbon footprint as greens are generat ed locally. \\nAs acknowledged earlier this process is a soilless development \\nprocess hence the consumption of brutal synthetic s ubstances \\nused to treat the soil are limited because the proc ess is itself \\nself-sufficient to generate the required nutrients.  This process \\nalso has substantial benefits when compared to trad itional \\ncultivation like it involves less space, can be don e in vertical \\nformat, involves less human intervention and can be controlled \\nand managed distantly. \\n \\nHanif Fakhrurroja and Syahidul Akbar Mardhotillah i n [10] \\nproposed the techniques implemented in the hydropon ic \\nsystem. Plants could be developed by flooding their  \\nfoundations with the nutrient’s arrangement. In this process the \\nnewly developed plant with a thick stem is upheld w ith \\nmediums like alluvial soil balls or rock. The arran gement of \\nnutrients can be done through two different process es, either  \\nmatch up the side-effects or play around by mixing miniature \\nnutrients. The plant is supported with a nutrient a rrangement \\nthat contains full-scale nutrients like N, K, P, Ca , S, Mg and \\nminiature nutrients like Ni, Cu, Zn, Fe, B, Mn. The retention of \\nthe nutrient content is higher in hydroponic when c ontrasted \\nwith customary systems. \\n \\nThe NFT system is costlier because of its establish ment \\nprocess. To make up for the expense, the system should be able \\nto deliver better quality and quantity of the yield . There is also \\nanother category known as Indoor Hydroponics in whi ch the \\nlight source, temperature and humidity are controll ed by the \\nsystem. The technology received in hydroponic farms  assists \\nwith estimating the power of the light, electronic conductivity, \\ntemperature and humidity, as well as pH estimation of the \\nnutrient water. \\n                 III.     PROPOSED MODEL  \\n1.  System Description \\n     As we can observe from the given figure below, we are using \\nthe NFT hydroponics system and applying auto dosing  in it. \\nFirstly, we need to have the readings of all factor s affecting a \\nplant in the hydroponics system. The factors which affect a \\nplant are the pH, Temperature, and EC of the water in the \\nsystem. For these factors, we are using an Arduino UNO with \\nan EC probe, pH probe, and Temperature and humidity  sensor \\nto find out the readings/values to monitor them. We are using a \\nperistaltic pump to supply the nutrient solution to  the water \\nreservoir from which the water containing nutrients  can be \\nsupplied to our NFT system by a stepper motor. We h ave also \\ncreated a CAD model of our system which can be seen below. \\n \\n \\nFig.3: Designed Model \\n \\n \\n    Fig.4: CAD Model \\n \\nFig. 5: Circuit diagram of the proposed system  \\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: ULAKBIM UASL - GAZI UNIV.

Working \\nWe have programmed the system controller accordingly  it  \\n \\nwill take the values every 5 minutes given by all the sensors \\nincluding an image of the plant which can give the values of \\nRGB in the picture to know how many pixels are show ing the \\ncolor of the plant so as to compare it with the las t image and \\nfind out the difference in the no. of pixels displa ying the plant \\nresulting in finding out the minute differences in the growth of \\nthe plant. These values are taken to the controller and with these \\nvalues, it will see if the system is good for the plant or are there \\nany changes in the system that are required. For Example, if the \\npH value of the system is high in the system which is not good \\nfor the plant, so the controller will initiate the pH motor to pump \\nthe water with less pH in the system to make it a p referable \\nenvironment for the plants to grow. For the system to be able to \\ndo such functions the following set of features should be added \\nto the system. \\n \\na.  IoT \\nThe system begins by reading the temperature and hu midity \\nfrom DHT11 (Temperature and Humidity Sensor). After that, it \\nis checked if the values exist in the threshold ran ge and if not, \\nthe values are outside the normal range, the system will turn on \\nthe water pump to water the arrangement and decreas e the \\ntemperature. At the point when the value comes into  the scope \\nof the limit, the system will turn off the water pump. The system \\nat that point checks for pH value and the solenoid valve changes \\nthe pH till it arrives at the set value. All the in formation \\ngathered in this part can be seen through the web application. \\n \\nb.  Machine Learning \\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has created so much th at it can \\nprompt a clever control system fit for self-assessm ent. The \\njoined data from various sensors, through artificial intelligence \\nphilosophies like neural organizations (NNs), can p rompt \\nquality characterization of segregated data receive d from \\nexplicit sensors. The objective for the usage of AI  is the \\nimprovement of a system for the plan and preparing \\nparameterization of NNs that would be more complex than the \\nexperimentation technique (trial and error) normally utilized for \\nthese works.  \\nThe NN way to deal with the application was picked \\npredominantly due to the particular idea of hydropo nics, and \\nfurthermore for its effortlessness. Hydroponics sys tems are \\nexceptionally non-direct as a result of the non-lin earity of the \\norganic cycles included. Subsequently, assessment t echniques \\nwould not be appropriate, predominantly due to thei r high \\ncomputational requests in the instances of non-line ar systems. \\nFurthermore, exact logical models of the hydroponic s system \\ndon\\'t exist; accordingly, assessment strategies bec ome \\ninadmissible. From the pattern recognition methods, NNs were \\nviewed as the most fitting since it was concluded t hat the \\nindependence that artificial intelligence provides for this \\nmethodology is desirable over some self-assertive \\ndetermination of complicated numerical tools that o ther \\nexample acknowledgment procedures would require. Th e NN \\nmodel needs to recognize the elements of the actual  cycle, i.e., \\nthe hydroponic system. All the more explicitly, the  model is \\nutilized for the most part for the expectation of s tate factors as \\nopposed to simulation. All the information is gathe red during \\nthe entire developing time of the plant, for example, the 25 days \\nthat the plants are in the pods of the hydroponics system. \\n \\nc.  ANN Model \\nIn this part of our study, the ANN model consisted of three \\nlayers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an outp ut layer. The \\nquantity of hidden layers and the quantity of units in the hidden \\nlayer is controlled by trials. The construction of the nets utilized \\nin the study is shown in the following figure. Sour ces of info \\nare time arrangement information of 5 ecological co nditions \\n(sunlight radiation, inside temperature, inside hum idity, \\nnutrient, water temperature, and CO2). Outputs are the measure \\nof water and nutrients supplied to hydroponic plants. \\n \\nBackpropagation was utilized as the learning strategy, which is \\nmade out of two systems: feedforward and backpropag ation \\nweight training. The information tests were separat ed into two \\ninformational databases, a training informational database, and \\na testing informational database. A preparation inf ormational \\ndatabase was utilized for preparing the neural organization, and \\na testing informational collection was utilized for assessing the \\nexactness of the recognized model. This kind of model approval \\nis classified as \"cross-validation\". The preparatio n interaction \\nbrought about weight estimations of the ANN model f or the \\nconnection among information and yield boundaries. All \\nfactors were standardized in the range of 0 and 1, utilizing the \\nfixed least and greatest values both in preparing a nd testing \\nmeasures. \\n \\n \\nFig.6:  Artificial Neural Network Diagram \\n \\n     3.

We foun d out \\nthat it takes about 15 minutes to recover for the abnormal range \\nof EC and pH to the suitable range. \\n \\n \\nFig.2: NFT System \\n \\nThis research stated that automatic monitoring and control can \\nbe achieved by using a microcontroller and sensors for \\ndetermining the pH level of water solution in the h ydroponic \\nsystem. Change in pH level will result in the syste m adjusting \\nthe pH level with respect to the suitable solution.  In the Deep-\\nWater Culture Hydroponics system, water solution is  stored in \\nthe main tank for measuring the pH level with the s ensor and \\nalso for undergoing necessary changes. Six methods are \\nimplemented for this technique: study details, hard ware \\nidentification, software identification, hardware a nd software \\nconnections, data collection and analysis, and resolution. \\n  \\nAlso, in the proposed method for the use of EC and pH control \\nsystem, it receives a signal for the Arduino contro ller. For the \\ncontroller, regression equations were used for EC a nd pH to \\naffect the increase in values in the system.

CONCLUSION & FUTURE SCOPE  \\nThe main objective of this paper is to propose a mo del for a \\nhydroponics system with an automated dosing system.   The \\nframework consequently supplies nutrients and furth ermore \\nscreens the pH level, water level, and supplement f ixation. \\nWhen the observation is done adjustments are made t o be \\npossible i.e., it can be controlled accordingly lea ding to higher \\nproductivity.  We are expecting to make a robotized dosing \\nframework with no human mediation necessity with th e \\nassistance of a combination of IoT for observing. T his model \\nwill save water and manures, and give better yields as compared \\nto traditional farming methods.  \\n \\nAs current innovation patterns in software engineer ing are \\nthought of, some AI calculations can be pertinent o n \\ninformation accumulated from all around the globe by tangible \\nparts with the assistance of IoT. The utilization o f AI \\ncalculations can be utilized to upgrade the control  system to \\nimprove yield with any climatic conditions.

Introduction\\nGreenhouses and indoor farming systems play an important role in providing fresh food,\\nsuch as fruits and vegetables being high in vitamins and minerals. Greenhouses combine high crop\\nproduction per unit area with a high water use e ﬃciency per unit of produce [ 1], but at the cost\\nof high energy demand [ 2] and high investments. Greenhouse production is increasing in many\\ncountries worldwide [3] to provide fresh food, preferably produced locally [4]. However, educated and\\nexperienced labour is scarce. In many countries skilled labour to oversee all aspects of greenhouse crop\\nproduction [5] is lacking. The current COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the availability of seasonal\\nlabor is critical for horticulture production [ 6]. The need of highly educated and experienced crop\\nmanagers has increased, just like the need for more automation and remote control of greenhouses and\\nother farming systems. As farms become larger, or temporarily less accessible, remote monitoring\\nof climate, irrigation, and crop status becomes more important.

Due to climate change, natural resources such as water and (fossil-based) energy\\nare becoming scarcer and improving the resource eﬃciency becomes urgent. A greenhouse grower\\nneeds to make many decisions to simultaneously maximize production and to minimize resources.\\nCrop and greenhouse climate models and/or new intelligent algorithms can help the grower to oversee\\nall information available and to support complex decisions to predict yields and resource use.\\nToday’s high-tech greenhouses are equipped with diﬀerent standard sensors for monitoring light,\\ntemperature, humidity, and CO2 and for actively controlling diﬀerent actuators (e.g., lighting, screening,\\nheating, ventilation, cooling, CO2 dosing, fogging, dehumidiﬁcation, irrigation, and fertilizer dosing)\\nin order to control all growth factors important for crop production at every moment. Today’s growers\\ndetermine the climate, irrigation and crop management strategies based on experience and deﬁnes\\nthe setpoints for climate and irrigation control manually. Actuators then operate based on setpoints\\nconﬁgured in a process computer, while sensors give feedback on measured data for the control loop.\\nAdditional sensors monitoring crop status are able to provide the grower with further information\\non photosynthesis rate [ 7], sap ﬂow and hydraulic status [ 8] and leaf temperature [ 9] to be added\\nto his manual decisions. Automated greenhouse climate control algorithms have already been\\ndeveloped in the past and are today widely introduced in modern high-tech greenhouses [ 10–22];\\nhowever, automated control on crop status are still in its infancy.\\nDynamic climate models have been developed [ 10,18,23–28] which act as a digital twin of the\\nreal greenhouse. An overview of today’s greenhouse climate models is given in a previous study [29].\\nMechanistic models give the opportunity to be used for intelligent decision support on climate control\\nactions. Simulations of past or future scenarios provide information on how a di ﬀerent climate control\\nin the past could have improved crop production and which actions are required to reach a certain\\ncrop production goal in the future. These models can also be coupled with intelligent algorithms\\nto automatically determine climate setpoints, an action that is currently performed manually by the\\ngrower. In order to control crop production by an automated algorithm, mechanistic greenhouse\\nclimate and crop models can be used and coupled with a real greenhouse, to send automatically\\ndetermined setpoints via a process computer to control the diﬀerent actuators. Such optimum control\\nexperiments have been conducted with tomato [ 30,31], sweet pepper [ 32,33] or pot plants [ 34] in\\nthe past.\\nThe crop has a central role in every greenhouse production system. Crop management decisions\\nand actions are mostly taken by the greenhouse sta ﬀ. Manual labor is still required for planting,\\ncrop training, leaf and fruit pruning, and fruit harvesting in greenhouses with high-wire vegetable\\nproduction. While manual labor requirement is high, crop management decisions can be supported.\\nSince experienced and well-trained crop managers are scarce, crop simulation models can play a role\\nin decision making. An overview of greenhouse crop models and modelling approaches are given in\\nother studies [35–43]. Crop models can be used as virtual representations of reality [ 44]. They can\\nbe used to simulate diﬀerent growing conditions and crop management strategies and predict crop\\ndevelopment and yield, and fruit quality. Crop models can help to understand the crop behavior under\\ndiﬀerent growing conditions and can support the grower in making decisions.\\nAI algorithms are widely used in horticultural research and have recently been implemented\\nin practice. Main application ﬁelds are plant stress detection [ 45], fruit detection or counting [ 46],\\npest, disease, or weed detection [47–49], yield prediction or harvesting [50,51]. Diﬀerent camera and\\nspectroscopy systems in diﬀerent spectral ranges are used for detection, di ﬀerent computer vision\\nand machine learning algorithms are used for analysis. However, the use of AI for greenhouse crop\\nproduction control is still limited [52–57]. Recently a benchmark experiment has been conducted to\\nuse artiﬁcial intelligent (AI) algorithms to optimize net proﬁt of a cucumber crop in a greenhouse\\nexperiment during the ﬁrst Autonomous Greenhouse Challenge in 2018. In that experiment the winning\\nAI algorithm outperformed the human decisions of experienced growers [58]. Crop production (class A:'),\n",

The challenge was designed to make further breakthroughs\\nin fresh food production with fewer resources using AI algorithms for and automatic and remote control\\nof a greenhouse crop production. While the ﬁrst experiment [58] was simpler with only a 3–4 months\\ncontrol of cucumber production, this second experiment was more complex to prove the value of AI\\ncontrol over a longer six months period. A diﬀerent crop had to be grown, cherry tomatoes require\\nmore complex control since it can be controlled not only on yield but also on product quality. While in\\nthe ﬁrst experiment the crop was grown during a summer–autumn growing season, in this second\\nexperiment the crop was grown during winter–spring–summer. Other challenges were added such as\\nno ﬁxed product prices, but prices were dependent on fruit quality and fruit quality was dependent on\\nnutrient control, nutrient control was an oﬀtrade of yield (more income but lower prices) and product\\nquality (high prices but lower yield). Comparable to the ﬁrst experiment [ 58], ﬁve multi-disciplinary\\ninternational teams automatically controlled their own greenhouse compartment remotely, a sixth\\nteam of local experienced human reference growers acted as manually controlled reference. The goal\\nof the experiment was to maximize net proﬁt by realizing high yield and product prices and minimize\\nresource use and costs.\\nThe aim of this paper is to describe the results of the experiment in terms of net proﬁt, yields\\nand resource use, to analyze diﬀerent climate and crop management strategies, to explain the results\\nwith the help of a digital twin model of a virtual greenhouse, and to detect possible improvements\\nof automatic control for the future.

Materials and Methods\\n2.1. Greenhouse Compartments and Equipment\\nThe experiment described in this paper has been conducted in a high-tech greenhouse with\\nsix identical compartments at Wageningen University & Research, Bleiswijk, The Netherlands.\\nEach compartment measured 96 m 2 ﬂoor area and was equipped with technology comparable\\nto commercial high-tech greenhouses (Figure 1). The set-up is comparable to our earlier experiment\\ndescribed in [58] however, diﬀerences in the lighting systems apply. The artiﬁcial lighting system\\nconsisted of 6 high-pressure-sodium (HPS) lamps (capacity of 100µmol/m2/s, ePapillon ﬁxture of Lights\\nInteraction Agro with a Philips Master GreenPower Plus 1000W EL light bulb, The Netherlands) and 8\\nmulti-spectrum controllable LED lamps (capacity from 0 to 109 µmol/m2/s, from which 12 µmol/m2/s\\nis far-red and therefore not counted as PAR, the other spectrum channels are max. blue = 11, red = 49,\\nand white = 37 µmol/m2/s; Elixia, Heliospectra, Sweden). Power supply to the LED lamps was coupled\\nto the power supply of the HPS, meaning that LED lamps could only be used additionally to the\\nHPS-lamps. For control of natural light and energy saving two types of inside moveable screens\\n(LUXOUS 1547 D FR energy screen and OBSCURA 9950 FR W light blocking screen, Ludvig Svensson,\\nSweden) were present. For temperature control a rail pipe heating system on the ﬂoor and a pipe heating\\nsystem at crop height (peak capacity 180 and 30 W/m2, respectively) were installed, both controllable\\nindependently. Next to that, a continuous roof ventilation (ventilation area of 0.3 m2 opening per m2\\ngreenhouse), equipped with anti-thrips netting was available and a fogging system (maximum capacity\\nof 330 g/m2/h), and CO2 supply (maximum capacity 15 g/m2/h) were mounted.

Crop\\nThe experiment was conducted with an indetermined type of cherry tomato crop. Seedlings cv.\\n“Axiany” (Axia Seeds, The Netherlands) were sown on 19 October 2019, grafted on Maxifort rootstock,\\nplanted in rockwool cubes and were transplanted to the greenhouse compartments on 16 December\\n2019. Teams took over remote control on 20 December 2019. The crop was grown in a high-wire\\ngrowing system. Initial plant density and stem density were determined by the teams in advance and\\nvaried between 2.6 and 4.0 stems/m2, all teams opted for a 2-stem young plant. The reference started\\nwith 4.0 stems/m2. Changes in stem density during the cropping period were diﬀerent for the teams in\\ntime. The ﬁrst harvest was on 13 February 2020, and the last harvest was for all teams set to 29 May\\n2020. Based on this last harvest date, the date of topping (removal of head of the crop) had to be chosen\\nby the teams and diﬀered from 16 to 30 April 2020. The crop in the reference compartment was topped\\non 16 April 2020.\\nTeams sent weekly instructions with regards to stem density, and fruit and leaf pruning in the\\ntop of the canopy to the greenhouse sta ﬀ. Stem density over time ranged from 2.6 to 8.0 stems /m2.\\nFruit pruning strategies led to a diﬀerent maximum plant load of 500 to 800 fruits/m2. Crop parameters\\nsuch as stem elongation (cm per week), stem thickness (mm), fruit growth period (d), and truss\\nformation rate (#truss /week) were manually measured per week on 10 sample plants. The stem\\nthickness refers to the thickness of the stem just below the highest ﬂowering cluster near the plant\\ntop. The fruit growth period refers to the time between the day that the ﬁrst fruits on the cluster\\nclearly start to grow and the day of harvest of the cluster. Plant load (#fruits/m2) was estimated from\\nstem density, numbers of new and harvested trusses, and number of fruits per new truss, and was\\nweekly shared with the teams. Harvest was performed per truss, approximately ﬁve times every two\\nweeks. Harvest data on number of harvested trusses (# /m2) and fresh fruit weight (kg/m2) of class\\nA, were obtained manually by the greenhouse staﬀ. Additionally, fruit quality analyses were carried\\nout in the laboratory. Based on laboratory measurements of total soluble solids (TSS, ◦Brix), titratable\\nacid (Acid, mmol H3O+/100 g), % juice pressed from the fruit wall of the tomato (%Juice, %), breaking\\nforce of the fruit wall, as an indicator of the perceived ﬁrmness during chewing (Bite, N) and average\\nfruit weight (Weight, g), the fruit ﬂavor (0 = dislike, 100 = like) were calculated with the WUR Flavor\\nTomato Model version 2.1 (update 2011) [59]. Results were shared with teams every second week.\\n2.5. Resource Use Eﬃciency\\nResource use e ﬃciency was calculated based on measured data: energy use e ﬃciency for\\nheat (MJ/kg tomato) and electricity (kWh/kg tomato), CO2 use eﬃciency (kg CO2 dosage/kg tomato),\\nwater use eﬃciency (L supplied/kg tomato), fertilizer use eﬃciency (g fertilizer/kg tomato). Fertilizer use\\neﬃciency was estimated based on the average supply EC and using the rough relation that 1 EC\\ncorresponds to 1 kg of dissolved salts per m3 of water.\\n2.6. Economics\\nNet proﬁt was calculated based on income minus costs. The income was determined from the kg\\ntomato fruits harvested x price per kg fruits and fruit quality. The price depended on fruit quality,\\nnamely its Brix value, and on the season (Figure A1). The costs were based on the operational costs\\nrelated to resources used by the teams during the experiment. Initial costs for the young plants (costs of\\na young plant x number of young plants placed in the compartment) were € 2.00 for a 1-stem plant.\\nand € 2.20 for a 2-stem plant.

With the availability of this digital twin of the real\\ngreenhouse, a detailed analysis can be performed to better understand the roles of diﬀerent growth\\nfactors such as light, temperature, CO2 etc.\\nThe virtual greenhouse crop production model consisted of a combination of a dynamic greenhouse\\nclimate model KASPRO [24] and a tomato crop model INTKAM [43]. The combined model assumes\\nadequate supply of water and nutrients and ignores the presence and e ﬀects of pests and diseases.\\nThe KASPRO model computes the greenhouse climate as a function of the realized outside weather\\nconditions in our experiment and the realized greenhouse climate control settings in our greenhouse\\nwith the real parameters of construction and equipment. The model processes these control settings by\\na control algorithm comparable to the ones used in the real greenhouses. The climate model output\\nconsists of various climate parameters, such as light intensity, temperature, CO2 concentration and air\\nhumidity. This output is then used as input for the tomato crop model INTKAM [43], which computes\\ndaily gross photosynthesis from the sum of hourly photosynthesis rates. The hourly photosynthesis\\nrates are the outcome of a dynamic crop architecture (leaf area index and plant load) under the\\ndynamic climate conditions. Crop photosynthesis minus crop dissimilation results in the amount of\\ncarbohydrates produced. The daily amount of carbohydrates is then partitioned over the growing\\norgans (roots, stems, leaves, fruits) according to their relative potential growth rates. Dry matter\\nfraction and fresh organ weights are calculated in a next step. In a last step, the harvest moment of\\nindividual fruits is determined on its physiological fruit age [60], tomato yield results. The net proﬁt is\\ncomputed as described above.\\nThe digital twin was used to calculate the tomato crop yield of each compartment, while using the\\nreal greenhouse construction, the real equipment, the real weather conditions and the realized climate\\nand crop management strategies in the individual compartment as inputs. The calculated output was\\nthe predicted fresh yield (kg/m2). The crop model was appropriately calibrated. With this calibrated\\ndigital twin of the greenhouse, the eﬀects of changes in light, air temperature and CO2 control strategies\\non fresh production were investigated for each compartment of the experiment. The inﬂuence of light\\navailability was investigated by increasing or decreasing the number of lighting hours by max 3 h per\\nday, not changing the applied light intensity.

Crop Strategies and Production\\nFigure 14 shows the initial stem densities of the diﬀerent teams varying from 2.6 to 4.0 stems per\\nm2. A low initial stem density reduced the costs for plant starting material. During the growing period\\nstem densities were increased up to 4.5–5.8 stems per m2, by allowing shoots to develop to secondary\\nstems. In the end phase of the crop cycle, just before topping, the reference growers (303) doubled\\nstem density to 8.0 stems per m2. The purpose was to enable the development of two additional fruit\\nclusters per stem. However, since labor costs were related to stems per m2, this action resulted in the\\nhighest labor cost (Figure A5), and a reduction in net proﬁt (Figure A4), while boosting production at\\nthe end (Figure 16).\\nSensors 2020, 20, x 12 of 29 \\n \\nhighest labor cost (Figure A5), and a reduction in net profit (Figure A4), while boosting production \\nat the end (Figure 16). \\nFigure 14 and Table 1 show the chosen topping dates of different teams, varying from April 17 \\nto 30.

Economic Result\\nThe net proﬁt is for most of the growers the most important performance indicator. This means\\nthat one should aim for a high production and product prices, while minimizing resource use and\\ncosts associated. Table 3 shows and overview of realized total income, total costs, and net proﬁt in\\ndiﬀerent compartments.\\nTotal income consists of the amount of fruit harvest, fruit quality and product prices. Product\\nprices per kg tomato were assumed to vary with fruit quality (Brix) during the growing period,\\nreﬂecting market reality (Figure A1). Since fruit quality varied for di ﬀerent compartments during the\\ngrowing season (Figure 17), product prices varied as well (Figure A2). Together with the realized fruit\\nharvest (Figure 16) this was leading to the realized income (Figure A3, Table 3). Highest income was\\nrealized by the strategy in 306 (37.2 €/m2).\\nTotal costs (Table 3) consists of the amount of resource use (Table 2) and costs of the resources\\n(see Section 2.7).

Performance Analysis\\nThe availability of the well validated greenhouse climate and crop models KASPRO-INTKAM;\\nthus, the availability of a digital twin of the greenhouse tomato production, allowed the use of the\\nmodels for a quantitative performance analysis. After automated distillation of important climate\\nstrategies (temperature, CO 2, and lighting) from the existing realized data, simulation results of\\nimportant climate parameters, such as temperature (Figure A6), CO2 (Figure A7) and light (Figure A8)\\nwere compared with realized climate parameters. Data shows that simulated and realized results\\nare comparable. After appropriate calibration of the crop model, simulated fresh weight of harvest\\n(Figure A9) was compared to realized crop production. Data shows that the simulated and realized\\nresults are comparable during the largest part of the harvest period. However, Figure A9 shows that the\\nﬁnal boost in the last two weeks after topping was not captured. Further improvements on the model\\nwould be needed for a closer match in these last weeks by reﬁnements on the dry matter partitioning\\nbetween generative and vegetative parts and the gradual increase of the ripening speed after removal\\nof the plant apex. A more in-depth analysis of the performance during this period was not conducted.\\nAfter this model validation, a performance analysis was carried out, analyzing the e ﬀects of\\nchanges in control strategies on fresh production and net proﬁt for each compartment of the experiment.\\nAs crop growth is predominantly aﬀected by the availability of light and CO2 and the greenhouse has\\nto be at a favorable temperature to allow a proper growth and development of the crop, a sensitivity\\nanalysis was carried out on changes in these three major parameters. Data shown on net proﬁt only.\\nFigure 19 shows the simulated eﬀect of variations in CO2-supply on net proﬁt with respect to\\nthe strategy as applied by the di ﬀerent teams. Each team has controlled the CO 2-conentration in a\\ndiﬀerent way resulting in a range of CO2 dosing from 7.2 kg/m2 for compartment 303 to 11.7 kg/m2 for\\ncompartment 301. The sensitivity was evaluated by changing the CO2 setpoint by −100 to +50 ppm,\\nwhile also changing the dosing capacity from 50 to 200 kg/ha/h. This resulted in a changed CO2 supply\\n(kg). The lowest CO2 setpoints, reduced the production for some teams substantially, up to 0.72 kg/m2,\\nrepresenting a value of €1.80 per m2 for team 301. At a CO 2 price of €0.08 per kg it is clear that the\\nreduction of income is far more than the savings on CO2, so reduction of CO2-dosing is not beneﬁcial\\nfor proﬁtability.

The product quality is determined by the \\nsize (too small fruits have a lower price ) and Brix (fruits with higher Brix have a higher price, \\ndepending on season). With the choices in cultivation, growers aim on realizing a certain fruit  size. \\nAs fruit size is negatively correlated to the number of fruits (per stem, per m 2), reaching the target \\nfruit size means that the grower has to manage the number of fruits produced. The number of fruits \\nis determined by the number of trusses per stem, the number of fruits per truss and the stem density. \\nIn order to obtain the desired total number of fruits, the number of fruits per stem is to a certain extent \\ninterchangeable with stem density. However, given the fact that  in this challenge the fruits were \\nharvested and sold per cluster , the maximum number of fruits per cluster is constrained.

The product quality is determined by the size\\n(too small fruits have a lower price) and Brix (fruits with higher Brix have a higher price, depending on\\nseason). With the choices in cultivation, growers aim on realizing a certain fruit size. As fruit size is\\nnegatively correlated to the number of fruits (per stem, per m2), reaching the target fruit size means\\nthat the grower has to manage the number of fruits produced. The number of fruits is determined by\\nthe number of trusses per stem, the number of fruits per truss and the stem density. In order to obtain\\nthe desired total number of fruits, the number of fruits per stem is to a certain extent interchangeable\\nwith stem density. However, given the fact that in this challenge the fruits were harvested and sold\\nper cluster, the maximum number of fruits per cluster is constrained. This was done in order to\\nlimit the diﬀerence in maturity of the consecutive fruits within a cluster [60]. It limits the number of\\nfruits on a truss to maximal 16 for single, and 20 for split trusses. Realized data on crop performance\\n(Figures 14–16; Table 1) show that some teams opted for a large number of fruits and a lower number\\nof stems per m2, which saved on labor, where other teams applied a higher stem density and a lower\\nnumber of fruits per cluster, which promoted evenly ripened clusters. It could be concluded that these\\nare important parameters for optimization. Automated recording of relevant crop data is needed in\\nthe future to allow automated optimization.\\nIt was assumed that fertigation would have an eﬀect on fruit quality, and therewith on proﬁtability.\\nWhereas it is often assumed that the EC in the root zone has a positive eﬀect on the Brix value of the\\ntomato fruits [61], for this cherry tomato variety a good correlation could not be found. Figure 12 shows\\nthe correlation of measured Brix and average EC in the drain value during the 35 days prior to the\\nharvest, which, for ease of computation, was considered as the fruit growth period. Combining all data,\\nthere was no eﬀect of the EC in the drain on the Brix, which was on average 8.7. Similarly, there was\\nno eﬀect of the EC in the drain on the fruit dry matter content, which was in average 9.0% (data not\\nshown). A parallel peak in EC and Brix values was observed halfway the harvest period for 305 but\\nthis was not a trend as other compartments also showed periods with a notably higher EC that did not\\nresult in an increased Brix. It could be concluded that the data and available knowledge on the used\\ncherry tomato variety do not allow for automated optimization yet.\\nIn the performance analysis, simulations with the virtual greenhouse, and crop model were carried\\nout to analyze the eﬀect of diﬀerent growth factors on crop production and net proﬁt. Cumulative fresh\\nproduction of cherry tomato could be well parameterized and simulated, apart from the under-estimated\\nproduction at the end of the growing cycle that was observed for all compartments.

However, when the CO2 dosing was strongly\\nreduced a clear reduction in production and net proﬁt could be observed. In general, increasing CO2\\ndosing compared to the levels already applied by the teams hardly increased net proﬁt. High levels of\\nCO2 dosage during summer did not result in high air CO2 concentration, and therefore not in increased\\nproduction, because window opening led to loss of the supplemented CO2. In winter, when windows\\nare closed, CO2 dosage does in general lead to elevated air CO2 concentration and production increase.\\nThe limitations then are set by the crop that knows limits to the amount of CO 2 it can absorb and\\nconvert into carbohydrates. However, teams seem to have used high enough CO 2 concentrations\\n(Figure 19). It could be concluded that at increased dosing capacities and CO2 setpoints, the additional\\nrevenue of the crop hardly exceeded the additional costs for CO2 beyond the realized CO2 strategies\\napplied in the experiment. However, the control of CO 2 clearly oﬀers possibilities for autonomous\\ncontrol to optimize CO2 dosage in relation to ventilation management (costs) versus CO2 concentration\\nand crop production (income).\\nSimulations with the virtual greenhouse and crop model were also carried out to study the eﬀect\\nof temperature on crop production and net proﬁt. The e ﬀect of temperature on crop growth and\\ndevelopment has a number of aspects and is therefore complex. With regards to photosynthesis,\\nthe eﬀect temperature is small within moderate ranges (18–24 ◦C) [62], which implies that gross\\ncarbohydrate production will not change much. Temperature has a much stronger eﬀect on maintenance\\nrespiration [63], so, increased temperature leads to reduced carbohydrate availability for growth.\\nThere is also an eﬀect on the number of trusses developed. This is assumed to be linear [36], which was\\nconﬁrmed in the current experiment. Within the temperature ranges applied in this project, the truss\\nformation rate varied from 1.1 cluster per week at 19◦C diurnal average temperature to 1.47 cluster\\nper week at 24 ◦C diurnal average temperature (data not shown). If other growth factors stay the\\nsame, this would lead to more, but smaller fruits. Since smaller fruits might reduce the product\\nprice, a good grower balances temperature (=number of trusses formed), number of fruits per truss\\nand number of stems per m 2 in such a way that the maximum number of fruits with a satisfying\\nfruit weight is produced. Stem density is a strategic decision that can be changed only sporadically\\nduring the growing season, number of fruits per truss can be modiﬁed weekly, and temperature can\\nbe controlled at any moment; although, the response of the tomato crop in terms of production is\\nbased on the temperature management over at least several days or one week. It could be concluded\\nthat the temperature strategy oﬀers clear opportunities for autonomous control. Since temperature\\nmanagement inﬂuences the number of trusses formed through truss formation rate and fruit ripening\\ntime over time, camera systems could automatically detect these parameters. The other two parameters,\\nnumber of fruits per truss and the number of stems per m2, can be optimized by, e.g., sensors or model\\nestimates of the photosynthetic capacity of the crop.\\nSimulations with the virtual greenhouse and crop model were also carried out to study the eﬀect\\nof lighting strategies on crop production and net proﬁt. There is a strong di ﬀerence between the\\ninstantaneous eﬀect and the integrated daily eﬀect of light on crop photosynthesis. As long as light is\\nthe limiting factor, its increase will cause a higher photosynthesis rate. However, even if instantaneous\\nphotosynthesis has reached on optimum, the integrated daily value will change if the light period\\nis lengthened. This is the reason why more light caused more simulated growth and production\\n(Figure 21). However, the response is not the same during the entire growing season. It is assumed that\\njuvenile plants are sink limited in their growth, meaning that there are more carbohydrates produced\\nthan the small plants can process, which has also been incorporated in the crop simulation model.\\nIncrease of light in this phase only adds to costs, not to extra growth. There follows a transition phase\\nduring which growth changes from sink to source limited growth. An adult crop knows a source\\nlimited growth, and extra artiﬁcial lighting during this phase was proved to be ﬁnancially proﬁtable.'),\n",

Sensors, Algorithms, and Control\\nGreenhouses are highly non-linear, complex, multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) systems [64].\\nThe underlying production processes present diﬀerences in response times of the variables involved.\\nGreenhouse climate and crop photosynthesis respond rapidly to changes in control and external\\ninputs, whereas crop growth and production respond comparatively slow to changes in control [17].\\nWhereas greenhouse climate information is available with many datapoints, crop related information\\nis sparsely available. However, the performance of machine learning algorithms (e.g. deep learning,\\nneural networks), highly depends on the diversity and size of training data [65].\\nPrior to the start of the greenhouse crop experiment, teams could explore, build, and train algorithms\\nusing a virtual greenhouse environment emulated by the available climate-cropmodels [24,43]. The use\\nof synthetic training datasets has been shown to be very useful in earlier applications, when real-world\\ndata are not quantitatively and qualitatively suﬃcient for training purposes [51,66]. In the real growing\\nexperiment, contextually relevant data was collected via standard sensors, next to that data was\\ncollected by teams with additional sensors of their preference (see Section 2.3) to improve and increase\\nthe eﬃciency and robustness of their algorithms. During this exploration phase prior to the start of the\\nexperiment, teams should have accounted for such a systems’ architecture that would not be hampered\\nby the data availability during the transition from the virtual to actual growing environment. In other\\nwords, teams that selected model-based control using the available models, should have trained their\\nalgorithms with parameters/data that they would be able to monitor in the greenhouse experiment.\\nAdditional sensors of the teams varied from low-cost tailor made, to novel sensors for climate\\nand crop monitoring. Natural and mechanical ventilated climate sensors for temperature, humidity,\\nand CO2 as well as NIR and PAR sensors were placed by teams on di ﬀerent heights, to monitor\\nclimate homogeneity. Spatial mapping of the parameters supported algorithms of the teams on climate\\ncontrol decisions (ventilation, CO2 dosage, lighting strategy) and crop management (stem density, fruit\\npruning). The digital images of optical low- and high- resolution camera systems RGB, and thermal\\ncameras allowed teams to remotely and visually inspect crop growth and well-being, monitor the\\nnumber and ripening of the fruits as well as the temperature of the leaves at di ﬀerent crop heights.\\nWide-view cameras enabled the control of operations of actuators (e.g. lamps on/oﬀ, screen opening).\\nSome teams labelled the collected imagery datasets based on expert knowledge and used them for\\nphenotyping certain crop traits. In literature, several authors focused on spatial mapping of climate\\nor digital image data for greenhouse growing crops [ 67–72]. Here are still many opportunities for\\nautomated computer vision analysis and automated control in the future. Mechanical sensors collected\\ndirect feedback from sampled plants. Weighing gutters and crop load cells allowed real-time monitoring\\nof the crop and plant weight. Such data were potentially used by the teams in ﬁnding correlations\\nbetween crop and plant weight changes under di ﬀerent climate, irrigation and crop management\\ndecisions that could support their algorithms. Furthermore sap-ﬂow and stem diameter sensors on\\nﬁxed positions allowed automated monitoring of ﬂuid transport and stem diameter. The information\\nwas used by some teams for deﬁning their heating temperature and irrigation strategies as previous\\nresearch [73] reported associations of leaf temperature, stem and sap ﬂow measurements with the\\nwater status of the plant and drought stress.\\nEach team followed a di ﬀerent approach for determining their strategies and controls of the\\ngreenhouse climate and crop. However, the majority decided to breakdown the system into long-\\nand short-term decisions and controls. The decision-making scheme of team 306 consisted of three\\nmanagerial levels: strategic, tactical, and operational. The strategic level aimed at deﬁning their crop'),\n",

Conclusions and Future Works 2 \\nIn this research, deep learning techniques have shown their ability to correctly classify 3 \\nanomalies in many areas of research. However, hackers use new and innovative tech- 4 \\nniques to launch cyberattacks. While great attempts to track down these attacks have the 5 \\nadvantage that they continue to occur in multiple ways to cooperate with other potential 6 \\nattacks such as DDoS att acks and botnets. This paper proposes an anomaly detection 7 \\nmodel for IoT networks in smart agriculture using CNN-LSTM. It was performed on two 8 \\ndifferent datasets, namely IoT-23 and CICDDoS2019. The proposed model achieved high 9 \\naccuracy for current classifi cation strategies and modern deep learning applications. In 10 \\nterms of anomaly detection accuracy using the proposed model, the rate is 99.47%, and it 11 \\ncan be more efficient if applied at the edge of the network. In future work, we will inves- 12'),\n",

This highlights the need for more autonomous and remote-control strategies for greenhouse production. This paper describes and analyzes the results of the second “Autonomous Greenhouse Challenge”. In this challenge, an experiment was conducted in six high-tech greenhouse compartments during a period of six months of cherry tomato growing. The primary goal of the greenhouse operation was to maximize net profit, by controlling the greenhouse climate and crop with AI techniques. Five international teams with backgrounds in AI and horticulture were challenged in a competition to operate their own compartment remotely. They developed intelligent algorithms and use sensor data to determine climate setpoints and crop management strategy. All AI supported teams outperformed a human-operated greenhouse that served as reference.

Farms are becoming larger and greenhouse growers need to make complex decisions to maximize production and minimize resource use while meeting market requirements. However, highly skilled labor is increasingly lacking in the greenhouse sector. Moreover, extreme events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can make farms temporarily less accessible. This highlights the need for more autonomous and remote-control strategies for greenhouse production. This paper describes and analyzes the results of the second “Autonomous Greenhouse Challenge”. In this challenge, an experiment was conducted in six high-tech greenhouse compartments during a period of six months of cherry tomato growing. The primary goal of the greenhouse operation was to maximize net profit, by controlling the greenhouse climate and crop with AI techniques. Five international teams with backgrounds in AI and horticulture were challenged in a competition to operate their own compartment remotely. They developed intelligent algorithms and use sensor data to determine climate setpoints and crop management strategy. All AI supported teams outperformed a human-operated greenhouse that served as reference. From the results obtained by the teams and from the analysis of the different climate-crop strategies, it was possible to detect challenges and opportunities for the future implementation of remote-control systems in greenhouse production.', 'title': 'Cherry Tomato Production in Intelligent Greenhouses—Sensors and AI for Control of Climate, Irrigation, Crop Yield, and Quality', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf_files\\\\sensors-20-06430-v2.pdf', 'total_pages': 30, 'page': 29, 'page_label': '30', 'source_files': 'sensors-20-06430-v2.pdf', 'file_type': 'pdf'}, page_content='Sensors 2020, 20, 6430 30 of 30\\n73.

Critical variables include pH (n = 70), EC (n = 36), total dissolved solids (TDS) (n = 27), nutrient solution volume (NSV) (n = 42), and nutrient solution temperature (NST) (n = 28). The study highlights the need for robust frameworks incorporating advanced dosing frameworks and simultaneous dosing strategies to enhance dosing speed, accuracy, and robustness. A novel framework is proposed to address these gaps by integrating predictive analytics using multiple regression models.

This study provides a systematic scoping review of automated hydroponic nutrient dosing systems, focusing on potential of hydrogen (pH) and electrical conductivity (EC) dosing frameworks. Following preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses extension for systematic scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines, 3222 studies were retrieved and screened, with 89 meeting inclusion criteria for analysis. The review aimed to identify current research trends, dosing frameworks, critical variables, and research gaps. Results reveal a steady rise in publications from 2015 (n = 4) to 2022 (n = 18). Feedback loop frameworks and predictive analytics are equally represented (n = 45 each). Critical variables include pH (n = 70), EC (n = 36), total dissolved solids (TDS) (n = 27), nutrient solution volume (NSV) (n = 42), and nutrient solution temperature (NST) (n = 28). The study highlights the need for robust frameworks incorporating advanced dosing frameworks and simultaneous dosing strategies to enhance dosing speed, accuracy, and robustness. A novel framework is proposed to address these gaps by integrating predictive analytics using multiple regression models.

Conclusions and Future Works 2 \\nIn this research, deep learning techniques have shown their ability to correctly classify 3 \\nanomalies in many areas of research. However, hackers use new and innovative tech- 4 \\nniques to launch cyberattacks. While great attempts to track down these attacks have the 5 \\nadvantage that they continue to occur in multiple ways to cooperate with other potential 6 \\nattacks such as DDoS att acks and botnets. This paper proposes an anomaly detection 7 \\nmodel for IoT networks in smart agriculture using CNN-LSTM. It was performed on two 8 \\ndifferent datasets, namely IoT-23 and CICDDoS2019. The proposed model achieved high 9 \\naccuracy for current classifi cation strategies and modern deep learning applications. In 10 \\nterms of anomaly detection accuracy using the proposed model, the rate is 99.47%, and it 11 \\ncan be more efficient if applied at the edge of the network.

This highlights the need for more autonomous and remote-control strategies for greenhouse production. This paper describes and analyzes the results of the second “Autonomous Greenhouse Challenge”. In this challenge, an experiment was conducted in six high-tech greenhouse compartments during a period of six months of cherry tomato growing. The primary goal of the greenhouse operation was to maximize net profit, by controlling the greenhouse climate and crop with AI techniques. Five international teams with backgrounds in AI and horticulture were challenged in a competition to operate their own compartment remotely. They developed intelligent algorithms and use sensor data to determine climate setpoints and crop management strategy. All AI supported teams outperformed a human-operated greenhouse that served as reference. From the results obtained by the teams and from the analysis of the different climate-crop strategies, it was possible to detect challenges and opportunities for the future implementation of remote-control systems in greenhouse production.', 'title': 'Cherry Tomato Production in Intelligent Greenhouses—Sensors and AI for Control of Climate, Irrigation, Crop Yield, and Quality', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf_files\\\\sensors-20-06430-v2.pdf', 'total_pages': 30, 'page': 28, 'page_label': '29', 'source_files': 'sensors-20-06430-v2.pdf', 'file_type': 'pdf'}, page_content='19, 1807.

      "Anomaly detection in agriculture is a crucial aspect of ensuring the reliability and sustainability of agricultural practices. It involves identifying unusual patterns or outliers in sensor data that may indicate potential issues or threats to crop health, such as crop damage, disease, or pests.\n",
      "\n",
      "The significance of anomaly detection in agriculture can be understood in several ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Early Detection of Crop Damage**: Anomaly detection can help identify crop damage or disease at an early stage, allowing farmers to take corrective action and minimize losses.\n",
      "2. **Prevention of Zero-Day Attacks**: In the context of smart agriculture systems, anomaly detection can help prevent zero-day attacks, which are cyber threats that exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities.\n",
      "3. **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Protection**: Anomaly detection can also help protect smart agriculture systems from DDoS attacks, which can disrupt the normal functioning of the system.\n",
      "4. **Improved Food Production**: By detecting anomalies in sensor data, farmers can make informed decisions about crop management, irrigation, and fertilization, leading to improved food production and reduced waste.\n",
      "5. **Enhanced Reliability and Sustainability**: Anomaly detection can help ensure the reliability and sustainability of agricultural practices by identifying potential issues before they become major problems.\n",
      "6. **Climate Change Mitigation**: By detecting anomalies in weather patterns and soil conditions, farmers can adapt their practices to mitigate the effects of climate change and ensure food security.\n",
      "7. **Water Scarcity Management**: Anomaly detection can help farmers manage water resources more efficiently, reducing waste and ensuring that crops receive the right amount of water.\n",
